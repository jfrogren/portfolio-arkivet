[This](https://lu.app.box.com/file/833743232247) is an example of the information letter that was sent to the associations by mail informing them about Study III. Depending on what kind of association I contacted I edited the letter somewhat in order to reach out to the responders in a more personal way. In [this](https://lu.app.box.com/folder/141189777285) folder in LU Box you will find all of the different versions of the information letter.
