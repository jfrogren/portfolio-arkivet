Out of curiosity, I started looking into the journal "Social Epistemology" that SH at explained she aimed to publish her paper in. In several issues of the paper, the name **Miranda Fricker** and her theory **Epistemic injustice** popped up. I had never heard of it. 

The essay [Epistemic Contribution as a Central Human Capability](/pdfs/fricker2015.pdf) was my intruduction to her theory and [here](https://github.com/jfrogren/bibnotes/blob/master/fricker2015.md) are the notes I took when reading the essay.
