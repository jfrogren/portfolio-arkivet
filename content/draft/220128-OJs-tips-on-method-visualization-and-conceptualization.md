OJ wrote a mail to me with the following links about impacts on understanding, learning and participation:

* [Generic Learning Outcomes](https://archive.fo/cf9hw) by Art Council England
* [Evaluation Guidance](https://archive.fo/eltiU) by the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NMHF) in UK

He also attached a document about [Toolkit Evaluating](https://lu.app.box.com/file/913622683317) and commented this document in the folllowing way:

> Vad gäller begreppet ”research user” används det t ex i bifogat dokument Toolkit_Evaluating: “Be precise about who has benefited from the research, consider stakeholders (may include researchers, collaborators and groups of the public directly involved in the research), research-users (individuals and organisations), the public and end-users.”

> Samtidigt skriver de i text bl a: “Capturing stakeholder’s, research user’s and beneficiary’s perspectives of impact”.
 
Furthermore, OJ sent [a figure](https://lu.app.box.com/file/913630612264) which was an example of how the method (in relation to the sample size) used in study II could be visualized.
