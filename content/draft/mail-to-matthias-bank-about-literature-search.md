Hej Matthias,

För några år sedan hjälpte du min kollega Oskar Jonsson att söka efter litteratur i ett antal databaser



## Updating the search strings
The question is what terms I should use for the coming literature searches. If I just add the new terms to the ones employed before, I get the following three sections:

* ( "user participation" OR "public involvement" OR "user involvement" OR "participant involvement" OR "patient partnership" OR  "public participation" OR "public and patient involvement" OR "PPI" OR "user-driven research" OR "community-based participatory research" OR "co-design" OR "participatory design" OR "co-production of knowledge" OR "patient-driven research" OR "transdisciplinary research" OR "collaborative research" OR "citizens’ involvement" OR "citizens’ participation" OR "citizen science")
* ( research )
* ( attitude* OR belief* OR opinion* OR perception* OR ideas OR judgement* OR "ways of thinking" OR experience* OR awareness OR willingness )


## New search string syntax for the respective databases
I will now apply these updated search phrases in the same way as the searches that were made before and see what result I will get. This means the following syntax and scope for the respective databases:

### Embase
