So, what should I include in the analysis of study II? Well, to begin with in order to decide that I need to back to the overarching aim and the research questions. As of now, I have written that: 

> The overarching aim was to report descriptive baseline results (basic demographics + motivations + hindrences) from the UserAge panel study targeting 60+ citizens in Sweden and investigate the awareness and attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among 60+ citizens in Sweden. 

As for the research questions there are two such questions that I aim to give an answer to in the study. The first one is:

> What are the awareness and attitudes towards active involvement in research among 60+ citizens in Sweden?

And the second one is:

> How do the willingness of 60+ citizens to be actively involved in research on ageing and health relate to age, sex, level of education, economic situation, and perceived health?

In other words, based on the overarching aim(s) the results should be divided into two overall section, namely the following:

* A report of the descriptive baseline results from the UserAge panel study targeting 60+ citizens in Sweden
* An investigation of the awareness and attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among 60+ citizens in Sweden

I will now try to list more in detail what kind of analyses I find necessary to do under each of these two overarching aims.

## 3.4. Attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among 60+ citizens in Sweden
* What are the attitudes of 60+ citizens in Sweden towards public involvement in research on ageing and health?


## 3.5. Willingness to be actively involved in research on ageing and health
* How willing are the respondents to be actively involved in research on ageing and health?

### 3.5.1. Preferred kind of research involvement of respondents willing to be actively involved
* What kind of research involvement is preferred by respondents willing to be actively involved? 

### 3.5.2 Preferred ways of getting informed about the possibilities to get actively involved in research (by the respondents willing to be actively involved)  
* Through *which channels* do respondents who state that they are willing to be actively involved in research want to be reached?
* *By whom* do the participants who state that they are willing to be actively involved in research want to be reached?

### 3.5.3. Relation between willingness and demographics and health 
* How do the willingness of 60+ citizens to be actively involved in research on ageing and health relate to age, sex, level of education, economic situation, and perceived health?

I think sorting the results like this can give me a good overview of what analysis I should do. The question is if I can really include this much descriptive data in a single article. What has to be done next is to clean all necessary data, do the required analyses (and prepare variables in order to be able to do those analyses) and describe everything under *Material and methods* and *Results*.
