I took the initiative for a discussion with CM about structuring a research article based on data from the panel study because she is also in the process of doing so. It was mainly the methods section I had in mind, but CM also gave me some tips on how the results part can be structured.

## Methods
In the method section, CM said that she made the following division:

* As an overall heading: **Materials and methods**. Here the context is first described (alternatively under a separate 'Study context' heading perhaps?)
* Then the subheading **Participants and recruitment**
* Then the subheading **Data collection procedure**
* Then the subheading **Materials**. Here is a description of how you have dichotimized your questions, so everything you have tinkered with when it comes to the questions should be described under this heading
* Then the subheading **Data analysis**. Here, the analysis must be described in such a detailed way that someone will be able to repeat the analysis.
* At the end of the method section is the heading **Ethical considerations**


## Results
CM begins its results section with the subheading **Description of participants** where the demographics and health of the study population are described as well as their previous experience of having been involved in research both in the usual way and so-called actively involved.
