Yesterday, based on an advice from RL, I created a Gantt chart for the remaining period of my doctoral studies. I used an R package called [ganttrify](https://github.com/giocomai/ganttrify)  that I read about at [Medium](https://medium.com/european-data-journalism-network/beautiful-gantt-charts-with-ggplot2-80ccd8c2c788).

I think that this Gantt chart can really help me to focus on the right thing at the right time as well as provide me with a good overview of the project as a whole.
