Today, I got a call from External relations at LU asking if I was interested in participating in a [panel discussion](https://web.archive.org/web/20210121135329/https://www.lu.se/evenemang/focus-career-are-you-interested-pursuing-career-phd-student) about what it is like being a PhD student. They wanted to have four PhD student representatives from different fields, two from Malm√∂ University and two from Lund. I explained I was not that representative for an average PhD student at the Faculty of Medicine, but she said it did not matter. What they were after was sories of different journeys into PhD studies, not necessarily the most common one. After a bit of thinking, I decided to say 'yes'. I think it can be interesting and useful for me. It may offer a good opportunity to reflect upon what I am actually doing and why I am doing it, and it might also be a chance to do some networking and get to know some people that might be good to know for my futue career.
