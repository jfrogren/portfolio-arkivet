[CASE steering committe](https://archive.fo/wDHqv), where I am the PhD student representative, had a meeting today, and [here](https://lu.app.box.com/file/792381127073) are the offical notes from the meeting. I was impressed to see and hear PH explain that once he realised that distance meetings and education would be here to stay, he had invested in such a nice setup with a real studio microphone and everything. I think more people should follow his example. 

Related to the content of the meeting, SI rightly pointed out that in order to dig deeper into the subjects we are discussion and really be able to be creative together it is necessary to meet away from keyboard (AFK) and for a longer period of time. So, I really support the idea that we will set up a kind of workshop this automn to discuss future visions, etc. This was something that was discussed towards the end of the meeting. Happy that I will be able to be a part of that visionary workshop, it feels like  a privilage considering I am just a PhD student.
