Today we got a reply from the editor(s) of the journal [International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph), with only minor revisions on the article manuscript that constitutes the first article in my dissertation!

Three reviewers had gone through our article manuscript and from two of them the feedback seemed adequate, while the third reviewer mostly left some confusing comments. 

However, they initially gave us only five days to edit it, but after OJ contacted them, they agreed to give us eight days. I have promised OJ that I will help him out on Friday this week. Before that I need to focus on getting somewhere with study II and on reconsidering the time plan and create a more realistic and more detailed and updated one.
