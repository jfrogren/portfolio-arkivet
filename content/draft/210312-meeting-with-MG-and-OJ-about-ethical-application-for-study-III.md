Today, we (MG, OJ and I) had another meeting about the ethical application for study III. I took some notes (in Swedish) which can be found
[here](/210312/notes-from-meeting-with-MG-and-OJ-about-ethical-application-for-study-III.html).

Also, after the meeting MG sent [her comments](/210312/MGs-comments-on-my-document.html) on my document and [her comments](/210312/MGs-comments-on-OJs-document.html) on OJ's document. And a few minutes after OJ sent [his comments](/210312/OJs-comments-on-my-document.html) on my document and [his comments](/210312/OJs-comments-on-MGs-document.html) on MG's document.
