SS and I had a meeting in which I presented the analyses I have done so far and he commented on it. It was a very fruitful meeting in which SS pointed out several good points and really gave me concrete and constructive feedback on what I had been doing so far. SI dropped in an joined the conversation during the last half an hour and that what good since we then could make some crucial decisions together that she also was a part of, not just SS and me. [Here](/210209/notes-from-discussing-data-analyses-with-SS.html) are my notes from the meeting.
