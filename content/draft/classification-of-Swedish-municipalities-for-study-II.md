In the data set for study II, there is a variable called 'LÃ¤nKommun' where the participants' home municipality is registered based on [Sweden's municipal codes](/pdfs/Municipality_borders_of_Sweden_with_names_and_codes_from_SCB_2005.pdf). OJ, which has long advocated an analysis of the data linked to urban / rural living, pointed out that the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) [Sveriges kommuner och landsting (SKL)] has produced a [classification system](/pdfs/classification-of-swedish-municipalities.pdf) "_in which the municipalities are divided into a total of nine groups on the basis of structural parameters such as population and commuting patterns_". All Swedish municipalities have thus been classified according to this system [in the following way](/htmlfiles/municipality-classification-table-for-study-II-interactive.html). 

What I will do now is to create a new variable called 'MunicipalityClassification' where I will classify the participants' home municipalities into the nine groups.
