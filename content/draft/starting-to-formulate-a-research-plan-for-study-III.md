Today, MG, OJ and I had a follow-up meeting to begin the work of formulating a research plan for study III within the framework of the project 'Bostadsförsöket'. Although the meeting was a bit tentative and scattered, it was fruitful, and one must probably accept that the discussions will be like this at the beginning of a project. I made some notes from our meeting which you can find [here](/210219/notes-from-planning-meeting-for-study-III.html).
