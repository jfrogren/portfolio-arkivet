At one point in time I have downloaded the following article:

* Kasperowski, D., & Brounéus, F. (2016). [The Swedish mass experiments — a way
of encouraging scientific citizenship?](/pdfs/kasperowski2016.pdf). Journal of Science Communication,
  15 (1).
  
However, I did not read it properly until now. [Here](https://github.com/jfrogren/bibnotes/blob/master/kasperowski2016.md) are the notes [in Swedish] from my reading.
