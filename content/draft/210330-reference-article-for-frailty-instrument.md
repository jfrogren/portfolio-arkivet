OJ sent me the article upon which the frailty questions in the survey questionnaire was based. It is the following article:

* Eklund, K., Wilhelmson, K., Landahl, S., & Ivanoff-Dahlin, S. (2016).
  [Screening for frailty among older emergency department visitors: validation of
  the new fresh-screening instrument](/pdfs/eklund2016.pdf#page=3). BMC emergency medicine, 16(1), 1â€“7.
