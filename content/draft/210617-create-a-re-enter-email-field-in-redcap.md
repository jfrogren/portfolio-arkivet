One thing OJ and SI pointed out in their [feedback](https://lu.app.box.com/file/833835914962) on the survey was that we do not have the right to collect the names of the respondents since we did not include such a request in the ethical application. Rather, in order to be of the safe side, OJ then suggested to ask the respondents to re-enter their email addresses as a security measure since they could easily misspell it once but not twice. 

I asked our REDCap expert on Lund University, AJ, how to do that and she suggested me to have a look at [this tutorial](https://archive.fo/ju6Cn#selection-1967.20-1967.51).
