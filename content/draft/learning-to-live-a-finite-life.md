When reading the book [Handbook of Theories of Aging](https://web.archive.org/web/20210121131041/https://www.springerpub.com/handbook-of-theories-of-aging-9780826129420.html)  as part of the course *Theories of Ageing*, I realised that I missed a perspective from philosophy or the humanities; a perspective that more explicetely emphasized the ethical, philosophical and theological aspects of ageing.

Thus, I started looking around elsewhere and after a while I found the [following text](/pdfs/baars2017.pdf) by the Dutch researcher Jan Baars in a relatively recent (well, well) issue of [The Gerontologist](https://web.archive.org/web/20201114002818/https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist). 

It really captured very well the dimension of ageing that I had been missing, and I hope that I will be able to incorporate it into the writing of my assignment 2 in this course and hopefully also to be able to refer to it later on, for example in the kappa.
