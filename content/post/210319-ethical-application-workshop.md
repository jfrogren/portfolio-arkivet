MG, OJ and I tried another way of working on the ethical application today. During 3.5 hours in the afternoon we took turns in editing different attachments of the ethical application. I had mistakenly put both the letters and informed consents (to the potential respondents) and the questionnaire in one single file and marked it as *Attachment 6*. However, OJ rightfully pointed out that the letters and informed consents should constitute a separate attachment, namely *Attachment 5*. Thus, during the afternoon we took turns in editing three attachments of the ethical application and when we were done for the day, the result looked like this:

* [Attachment 1](https://lu.app.box.com/file/792233791635): Description of research project 
* [Attachment 5](https://lu.app.box.com/file/792231413218): Information given to respondents 
* [Attachment 6](https://lu.app.box.com/file/792229919945): Questionnaires

MG explained that SI wanted to read through these documents at this stage and provide some overall feedback. I explained that I needed to focus on my other study during the upcoming days and that I could earliest start working on these documents again by Thursday next week (2021-03-25). 

We decided that we will not schedule any meeting next week but that I will instead go through the documents and finish them as much as I can (starting with Attachment 5 and 6 and then move on to Attachment 1) and whenever I feel stuck, I will send the questions and comments I have by mail to MG (and OJ) and then she/they will reply (most likely) the same working day. Once, I feel that I cannot improve the documents any more, I will forward them to MG and OJ and then they will continue to work on them.
