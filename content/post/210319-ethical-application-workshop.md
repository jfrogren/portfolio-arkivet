MG, OJ and I tried another way of working on the ethical application today. During 3.5 hours in the afternoon we took turns in editing different attachments of the ethical application. I had mistakenly put both the letters and informed consents (to the potential respondents) and the questionnaire in one single file and marked it as *Attachment 6*. However, OJ rightfully pointed out that the letters and informed consents should constitute a separate attachment, namely *Attachment 5*. Thus, during the afternoon we took turns in editing three attachments of the ethical application and when we were done for the day, the result looked like this:

* [Attachment 1](/210319/Bilaga_1_210319.html): Description of research project 
* [Attachment 5](/210319/Bilaga_5_Information_210319.html): Information given to respondents 
* [Attachment 6](/210319/Bilaga_6_Enkat_210319.html): Questionnaires

MG explained that SI wanted to read through these documents at tis stage and provide some overall feedback. I explained that I needed to focus on my other study during the upcoming days and that I could earliest start working on these documents again by Thursday next week (2021-03-25).
