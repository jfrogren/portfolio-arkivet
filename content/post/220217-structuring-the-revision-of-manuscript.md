Had a meeting with SI and OJ today on how to go about revising the manuscript for study III. Before the meeting, I had created [a document](https://lu.app.box.com/file/926168974216) in which I had structured the received feedback from the editor and the reviewers. During the meeting I received a lot of valuable feedback from SI and OJ and I added it directly into the document which now looks like [this](https://lu.app.box.com/file/926166690930).
