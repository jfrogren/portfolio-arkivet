Today we received a mail from *Etikprövningsnämnden* that our ethical application for Study III had been "approved with conditions". [Here](https://lu.app.box.com/file/815387288483) is the decision. As I understand it this means that it is approved but we still need to take into account and approve certain things before conducting the study. SI also commented the decision in a mail and what she wrote can be found [here](https://lu.app.box.com/file/815384578272).
