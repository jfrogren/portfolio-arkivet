Had a one hour Zoom meeting with MB at *Vetenskap & Allmänhet* [Science & Public] since I had been suggested during my last supervision that I should communicate more closely to him in order to gain a mutual understanding of what we expected from each other. And also as a means to assure that the communication about the Housing Experiment and the adjecent evaluation study went as smooth as possible. [Here](https://lu.app.box.com/file/815430417366) are the notes from our meeting.

In addition, MB also recommended me to read up on cognitive interview methodology and sent me [this pdf](/pdfs/210525-Att-göra-kognitiva-intervjuer-SACO-180516.pdf) which is an excerpt from a book by Marika Wenemark called [Enkätmetodik med respondenten i fokus](https://archive.fo/pKk6f) and [this pdf](/pdfs/210525-Kognitiva-intervjuer.pdf) about cognitive interviews by Fredrik Scheffer, who works with survey methodology at Statistics Sweden.
