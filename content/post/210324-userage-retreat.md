This UserAge retreat was held online through [Zoom](https://lu-se.zoom.us/j/62569767956) between 8.30 and 15.00. As preparatory material we were asked to read the first issue of 2021 of the journal [Ã„ldre i centrum](https://vibraweb.se/aic/211/#p=1).

I had also prepared [a presentation](https://jfrogren.github.io/210324/userage-retreat.html) of my doctoral project. Below you will find a list of the preparatory documents we were informed to read through before the retreat. And [here](/210324/my-notes-from-userage-retreat.html) are some notes (in Swedish) that I took from the event. [Here]() are the more official notes from the event.
