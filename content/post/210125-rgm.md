Today, we had a research-group meeting, mostly to discuss the working environment in relation to Covid and how people cope up with it. I realised that it must be quite har to lead a research group in this situation, not getting as much feedbac from the co-workers on your leadership as you are used to and probably need, but I think that SI is doing a very good job. I took some [notes](/htmlfiles/210125-research-group-meeting-notes.html) in the meeting about what we discussed.
