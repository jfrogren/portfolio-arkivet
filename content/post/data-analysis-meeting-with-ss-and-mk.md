In today's meeting with SS and MK, when going through the description of the method and methodology, I realised that it was lacking essential parts. We started out in the 'Statistical Analysis' description but they thought that I included things there that should be included earlier, such as the description of how (and why) certain variables were dichotomized, etc. So, I realised that there in a section in method or methodology one needs to specify how the concepts that one uses and brings from the aim and RQs are conceptualized in this particular study. To be more specific, one needs to explain what specific questions in the survey (or taken from elsewhere, such as the perceived health question) relate to the concepts (awareness, attitudes, willingness, etc.) being used.   

SS and MK were not so happy with the writing of why a logistic regression was done as it was written now ("to estimate the potential impact of demographics and health on the respondentsâ€™ willingness to be actively involved in research on ageing and health"). Rather than 'impact' one should write 'associated with' in the aim and in the RQs one should write how are these factors 'related to' x.

Furthermore we reformulated the aim and RQs so that they look like this now:

>Study purpose and research questions <br>

> The overarching aim was to investigate the awareness and attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among 60+ citizens in Sweden. <br>

> Research question 1: What are the awareness and attitudes towards active involvement in research among 60+ citizens in Sweden? <br>

> Research question 2: How do the willingness of 60+ citizens to be actively involved in research on ageing and health relate to age, gender, level of education, economic situation, and perceived health?
 
Let's see how this idea of an updated aim and updated RQs is received by my supervisors during tomorrow's supervision.
