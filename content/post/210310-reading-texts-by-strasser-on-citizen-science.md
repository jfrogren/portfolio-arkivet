In order to get a better idea of what citizen science is and strives to do, I started reading some of [the texts that MG had recommended](https://portfolio.arki.vet/2021/02/16/essential-reading-for-writing-an-ethical-application-for-study-iii/). First of all, I went through the [slides from a presentation](https://www.cswinterschool.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:3ff9db6f-3857-4733-910f-a40868dcedca/Strasser_Winter_School_2020_s.pdf) by a certain Bruno J.Strasser. My notes (in Swedish) from going through that presentation can be found [here](/210310/notes-from-presentation-by-strasser-on-citizen-science.html). Next, I read [an article](https://portfolio.arki.vet/pdfs/strasser2019.pdf) by the same Strasser (with some co-authors) and realised that it contained a more thorough version of what was included in the presentation. Anyway, my notes from that reading can be found [here](https://github.com/jfrogren/bibnotes/blob/master/strasser2019.md).
