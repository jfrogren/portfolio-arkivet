## About the earlier search strategy
As mentioned in the last post ("Overview of September's tasks"), a systematic search for articles about 'user participation in research' was done a few years ago, more precisely 15 September - 4 October 2017. The document containing all search strings and the listed articles is available [here](/pdfs/200910-earlier-literature-search-on-user-participation.pdf). Systematic searches were then conducted in four different databases:
*Embase*, *Scopus*, *Web of Science* (Core Collection) and *Academic search Complete*. The search terms employed were divided into three sections:

* ( "user participation" OR "public involvement" OR "user involvement" OR "participant involvement" OR "patient partnership" )
* ( research ) 
* ( attitude* OR belief* OR opinion* OR perception* OR ideas OR judgement* OR experience* OR "ways of thinking")

## Updating the terminology 
Those terms can be compared to the terms that I came up with in my recent post ("Overview of September's tasks"). I have marked the terms not employed in the earlier literature searches in bold text:

* attitudes, **awareness** and **willingness**. Possibly also perception (of). 
* public involvement, user involvement, user participation, **public participation**, **public and patient involvement** (**PPI**), **user-driven research**, **community-based participatory research**, **co-design**, **participatory design**, **co-production of knowledge**, **patient-driven research**, **transdisciplinary research**, **collaborative research**, **citizens’ involvement**, **citizens’ participation**, **citizen science**.

## Updating the search strings
The question is what terms I should use for the coming literature searches. If I just add the new terms to the ones employed before, I get the following three sections:

* ( "user participation" OR "public involvement" OR "user involvement" OR "participant involvement" OR "patient partnership" OR  "public participation" OR "public and patient involvement" OR "PPI" OR "user-driven research" OR "community-based participatory research" OR "co-design" OR "participatory design" OR "co-production of knowledge" OR "patient-driven research" OR "transdisciplinary research" OR "collaborative research" OR "citizens’ involvement" OR "citizens’ participation" OR "citizen science")
* ( research )
* ( attitude* OR belief* OR opinion* OR perception* OR ideas OR judgement* OR "ways of thinking" OR experience* OR awareness OR willingness )

But after some considerations, maybe I should add a few more search words or phrases. I am in fact considering to make a new division of the search phrases in the following way:

* citizen* OR public* OR people* OR patient* OR individual* OR person*
* attitude* OR belie* OR opinion* OR perceiv* OR perception* OR idea* OR judgement* OR "ways of thinking" OR experience* OR aware* OR willing* OR value*
* involv* OR engag* OR participat* OR collaborat* OR user-driven OR patient-driven OR co-produc* OR transdisciplinar* OR community-based 
* research* OR scien*

## New search string syntax for the Scopus database
I used the updated search phrases in the Scopus database (without any limitatons in relation to 'articles', only English, etc.) I first tried to conduct searches with the following syntax:

* TITLE ( citizen*  OR  public*  OR  people*  OR  patient*  OR  individual*  OR  person* )
* AND  TITLE ( attitude*  OR  belie*  OR  opinion*  OR  perceiv*  OR  perception*  OR  idea*  OR  judgement*  OR  "ways of thinking"  OR  experience*  OR  aware*  OR  willing*  OR  value* )
* AND  TITLE ( involv*  OR  engag*  OR  participat*  OR  collaborat*  OR  user-driven  OR  patient-driven  OR  co-produc*  OR  transdisciplinar*  OR  community-based )  
* AND  TITLE ( research*  OR  scien* ) 
* Limit to articles, reviews, editorials, English.
* 302 document results (2020-09-12) 

However, I thought the search was a little narrow, and thus decided to broaden one section as below:

* TITLE ( citizen*  OR  public*  OR  people*  OR  patient*  OR  individual*  OR  person* )
* AND  TITLE-ABS-KEY ( attitude*  OR  belie*  OR  opinion*  OR  perceiv*  OR  perception*  OR  idea*  OR  judgement*  OR  "ways of thinking"  OR  experience*  OR  aware*  OR  willing*  OR  value* )
* AND  TITLE ( involv*  OR  engag*  OR  participat*  OR  collaborat*  OR  user-driven  OR  patient-driven  OR  co-produc*  OR  transdisciplinar*  OR  community-based )  
* AND  TITLE ( research*  OR  scien* ) 
* 1,599 document results (2020-09-12)

This resulted in a possible too wide list of articles to handle but when I started to go through them, I realized that the result was very relevant even though some articles were outside of the scope. I went through the list and saved what I considered relevant articles to a list. After going through the first 600 articles I had marked 200 articles as relevant (including some marked from the first search and probably some doubles). 

I think that is good enough for me, but I will write to MB and ask him to conduct the same search in the other databases (Embase, Web of Science Core Collection and Academic search Complete) to assure that I am not missing something essential.

Oops! I just realised after looking at the article OJ recommended that I have missed out the search term motivation* (and its synonyms like reason*, etc.). I would need to include that and do the search all over again, but I guess I just ask MB to help me out. Here are all relevant synonyms to motivation I could come up with:
* impetus*
* incentive*
* inclination*
* interest*
* motive*
* reason*
* wish*
* disposition*
* drive

When including these search terms the search phrases become:
* TITLE ( citizen*  OR  public*  OR  people*  OR  patient*  OR  individual*  OR  person* )
* AND  TITLE ( attitude*  OR  belie*  OR  opinion*  OR  perceiv*  OR  perception*  OR  idea*  OR  judgement*  OR  "ways of thinking"  OR  experience*  OR  aware*  OR  willing*  OR  value* OR impetus* OR incentive* OR inclination* OR interest* OR motive* OR reason* OR wish* OR disposition* OR drive*)
* AND  TITLE ( involv*  OR  engag*  OR  participat*  OR  collaborat*  OR  user-driven  OR  patient-driven  OR  co-produc*  OR  transdisciplinar*  OR  community-based )  
* AND  TITLE ( research*  OR  scien* )
* 361 document results (2020-09-12)

When just including the new terms in that section (in order to exclude the documents I had already got), this was the result:
* TITLE(citizen* OR public* OR people* OR patient* OR individual* OR person*) 
* AND TITLE(impetus* OR incentive* OR inclination* OR interest* OR motive* OR reason* OR wish* OR disposition* OR drive*) 
* AND TITLE(involv* OR engag* OR participat* OR collaborat* OR user-driven OR patient-driven OR co-produc* OR transdisciplinar* OR community-based) 
* AND TITLE(research* OR scien*)
* 67 document results (2020-09-12)
* Added half a dozen documents to the list
* Had 207 documents in the list, when limiting to articles, reviews, editorials in English, 181 remained. I think this is a good start.
