Today I had a meeting with SI, SS and CASE's statistic consultant SU in order mainly to get SU:s feedback on the analyses I had been doing so far. [Here](/210304/data-analysis-meeting-with-SU-SS-and-SI.html) are my notes from the meeting.

SU was vary knowledgable and easy to talk with and I think that I can get very good support from her onwards. I was encourage to contact her further. Grateful that SI offers us PhD students this opportunity.
