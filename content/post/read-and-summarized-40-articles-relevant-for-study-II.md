Below you will find a list of articles seemingly relevant for study II that I found through the [literature searches](https://portfolio.arki.vet/post/initial-literature-searches-for-study-ii-with-librarian/) that I conducted with a librarian last months. 

I have spent the last week reading and summarizing them. Some are of course more relevant than others but I included all of them here anyway. If you click on an article, you will find the summary that I have created for it:
