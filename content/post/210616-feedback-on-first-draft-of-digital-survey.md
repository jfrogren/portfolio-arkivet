I have recently created a first draft of the digital survey for Study III using REDCap and sent it to OJ, MG and SI for feedback as described in [this](https://portfolio.arki.vet/2021/06/08/first-draft-of-digital-survey-in-redcap/) earlier post.

The feedback I received from them is gathered here:

* OJs [feedback](https://lu.app.box.com/file/833838701695) for both surveys and some [correspondence](https://lu.app.box.com/file/833839005527) with OJ about the interpretation of his feedback.
* MGs feedback can be divided into [feedback in an external document](https://lu.app.box.com/file/833827890989) and [feedback within REDCap](https://lu.app.box.com/file/833838005889)
* SIs feedback on the [first survey](https://lu.app.box.com/file/833835914962) and on the [follow-up survey](https://lu.app.box.com/file/833838289859)
