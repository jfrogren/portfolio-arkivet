Today we held the initial (online) meeting with MB who is working for the association 'Vetenskap och Allmänhet' [Science & Public] as part of the preparation for the Citizen Science project *Bostadsförsöket*, that will be held in September 2021, and during which I will collect data for my third sub-study. It was a good and well-structured meeting, much thanks to SI who managed well to fram the meeting and making us move ahead in the decision-making process. Participating in the meeting were SI, OJ, MG, MB and me. [Here](/210211/notes-from-initial-meeting-with-science-and-public-representative.html) are the notes from the meeting.
