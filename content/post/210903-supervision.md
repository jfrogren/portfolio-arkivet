Today I had supervision and here is the protocol. We mainly discussed the revision of the ISP. I had sent out [a draft]() before and my supurvisors had read and commented on it. Afterwards OJ and SI also sent me their feedback in written form.

* OJ's overarching feedback in [a mail](https://lu.app.box.com/file/857292002661) and in [a commented ISP draft](https://lu.app.box.com/file/857287586043)
* SI's feedback in [an external document](https://lu.app.box.com/file/857289380796)
