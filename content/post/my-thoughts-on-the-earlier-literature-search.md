## About the earlier search strategy
As mentioned in the last post ("Overview of September's tasks"), a systematic search for articles about 'user participation in research' was done a few years ago, more precisely 15 September - 4 October 2017. The document containing all search strings and the listed articles is available [here](/pdfs/200910-earlier-literature-search-on-user-participation.pdf). Systematic searches were then conducted in four different databases:
*Embase*, *Scopus*, *Web of Science* (Core Collection) and *Academic search Complete*. The search terms employed were divided into three sections:

* ( "user participation" OR "public involvement" OR "user involvement" OR "participant involvement" OR "patient partnership" )
* ( research ) 
* ( attitude* OR belief* OR opinion* OR perception* OR ideas OR judgement* OR experience* OR "ways of thinking")

## Updating the terminology 
Those terms can be compared to the terms that I came up with in my recent post ("Overview of September's tasks"). I have marked the terms not employed in the earlier literature searches in bold text:

* attitudes, **awareness** and **willingness**. Possibly also perception (of). 
* public involvement, user involvement, user participation, **public participation**, **public and patient involvement** (**PPI**), **user-driven research**, **community-based participatory research**, **co-design**, **participatory design**, **co-production of knowledge**, **patient-driven research**, **transdisciplinary research**, **collaborative research**, **citizens’ involvement**, **citizens’ participation**, **citizen science**.

## Updating the search strings
The question is what terms I should use for the coming literature searches. If I just add the new terms to the ones employed before, I get the following three sections:

* ( "user participation" OR "public involvement" OR "user involvement" OR "participant involvement" OR "patient partnership" OR  "public participation" OR "public and patient involvement" OR "PPI" OR "user-driven research" OR "community-based participatory research" OR "co-design" OR "participatory design" OR "co-production of knowledge" OR "patient-driven research" OR "transdisciplinary research" OR "collaborative research" OR "citizens’ involvement" OR "citizens’ participation" OR "citizen science")
* ( research )
* ( attitude* OR belief* OR opinion* OR perception* OR ideas OR judgement* OR "ways of thinking" OR experience* OR awareness OR willingness )

## New search string syntax for the respective databases
I will now apply these updated search phrases in the same way as the searches that were made before and see what result I will get. This means the following syntax and scope for the respective databases:
