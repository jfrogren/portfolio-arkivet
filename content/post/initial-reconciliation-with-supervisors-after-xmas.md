Before Christmas SI, OJ and me had decided to have an initial reconciliation after the new semester had started as a quick check-up before the more formal supervision that would follow the week after. During this meeting, SI pointed out that in the next manuscript for study II, the supervisors expected to receive a more detailed methodology description. She also pointed out that I needed to update my time plan ([Gantt chart](https://portfolio.arki.vet/images/gantt-chart-for-phd.png)) and send it out before the next supervision. I said that I would provide that to them and send it out to them on Thursday this week.
