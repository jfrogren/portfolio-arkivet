Today, I found what seems to be an interesting [book](https://archive.fo/AQjZw) on the relationship between methods and the crafting of knowledge. When browsing through [the various chapters](https://archive.fo/tdcnd), what in particular caught my attention was a chapter called "Writing as a Movement of Imagination, Reading as Companionship in Thought" by a certain Les Back. Not just that chapter, but other chapters as well had very catchy titles highlighting various aspects of knowledge work in the 21st Century (in particular in the social sciences), a topic that I find myself more and more interested in.
