During the [initial reconciliation](https://portfolio.arki.vet/post/initial-reconciliation-with-supervisors-after-xmas/) earlier this week, I had promised SI and OJ to send out an updated time plan for the whole remaining period of my doctoral studies.

I decided to use the same format as before, namely [ganttrify](https://github.com/giocomai/ganttrify) but I had troubles remembering how to create a chart using RStudio. After a while I found [this site](https://apps.europeandatajournalism.eu/app/ganttrify) where you could just create a table in Excel and then refer to it.

[Here](/htmlfiles/210114-ganttchart-table.html) is a Marked 2 (md -> html) version of the table I created and [here](/images/210114-ganttchart-for-phd-studies.jpg) is the updated time table in form of a Gantt chart.
