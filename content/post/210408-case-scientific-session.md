Case Scientific Sessions (CSS) are often very rewarding and result in broader, more comprehensive discussions than is the case in many other academic contexts where it can feel more confined. 

Today's CSS, with the title *Universal Design and Ageing* was no exception and it was exciting to hear how SI and PH had collaborated in writing a book chapter. I was also a little proud because SI highlighted our article  [Understanding the wicked problem of providing accessible housing for the ageing population in Sweden](/pdfs/jonsson2021.pdf) to illustrate how accessibility should not be considered as something that can simply be optimized, but that it is complex and requires considerations of various kinds. 

SI mentioned that it was I who introduced the theory about wicked problems in the housing accessibility discourse, which pleased me. I have felt for myself that even though I have been a bit sluggish in writing, I have conceptually contributed to bringing in some new relevant theories and some new perspectives on things in the research area. 

<!-- I also took some notes at the seminar which you can find here. 

PH and SI have written, are rather are about to finish a chapter in a book which unfortunately I did not get the name of but that will be published later this year on Studentlitteratur. Anyway, in their chapter they try to explain the differences between *accessibility* and *universal design*.

PH started out this seminar by presenting the universal design perspective. He explained that it is more of a mindset, rather than a simple measure, and gave an illustrative 

Seminar on the book chapter in May. Only seminar for authors and exoernal revisors. It is going to be delivered to studentlitteratur on September 1. 

Book i 750 pages. We will have a seminar on that.. 

SI gave the accessibility perspective, explaining that her starting point into accessibility on an academic level. Unfortunately, she said that ...

universal design is very much about the process...

PH - reflections on writing the chapter. Accessibility is not just objective and measurable but there are other aspects... we have expanded the understandings...

Fråga från Kiran: What would you like to add to accessibility in terms of subjectivity?

PH: Accessibility gets final shape in a lived situation, and there stigma is part of it. Example coffee shop photograph. Aspects not ust about being able to access but also aspects of society's view. He said that he would like to add 'stigma'.

OJ suggested to add aesthetics and emotions because that will add stigma to it. 

PH say that one contruibution is that accessibility and usability where you have a more predefined... while UD doesn't have it... the development that OJ suggest is something that can be considered relevant and a way to expand the bubble even further.

CM ... ue mentioned and that is actually wider than usability... she also mentioned 'sustainable'

I found an interesting [licentiate thesis](/pdfs/ayers2020.pdf) which links sustainability and wicked problems.


PH recommended the following [article](/pdfs/ericsson2020.pdf).
