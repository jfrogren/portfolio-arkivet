At the [last meeting](https://portfolio.arki.vet/2021/02/19/starting-to-formulate-a-research-plan-for-study-iii/) with MG an OJ, we decided that I should formulate a draft of a research plan for study III in Google Docs. I have now done that and it can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aqVR1XtiU_PSQ0YtKGLC0baZRdVJgScOXvpkITjgnWo/edit?usp=sharing).
