So, what should I include in the analysis of study II? Well, to begin with in order to decide that I need to back to the overarching aim and the research questions. As of now, I have written that: 

> The overarching aim was to report descriptive baseline results (basic demographics + motivations + hindrences) from the UserAge panel study targeting 60+ citizens in Sweden and investigate the awareness and attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among 60+ citizens in Sweden. 

As for the research questions there are two such questions that I aim to give an answer to in the study. The first one is:

> What are the awareness and attitudes towards active involvement in research among 60+ citizens in Sweden?

And the second one is:

> How do the willingness of 60+ citizens to be actively involved in research on ageing and health relate to age, sex, level of education, economic situation, and perceived health?

In other words, based on the overarching aim(s) the results should be divided into two overall section, namely the following:

* A report of the descriptive baseline results from the UserAge panel study targeting 60+ citizens in Sweden
* An investigation of the awareness and attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among 60+ citizens in Sweden
