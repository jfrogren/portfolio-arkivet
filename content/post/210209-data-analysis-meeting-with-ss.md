SS and I had a meeting in which I presented the analyses I have done so far and he commented on it. Below I will present a summary of what we discussed and agreed on:

* The instruments and measures that are brought up in the methods section, must be more explicitely motivated. There are propably good reason for including these instruments and measures in this particular study. However, the reasons given and how these instruments and measures connect to the research questions are not sufficiently explained at the moment.

* SS gave the advice to gather the measures that we designed under a heading called something like 'Study-specific questions'. This section should start out with a paragraph on how we developed our questionnaire with the particular questions used, then describe the ones that we are going to use in this paper.

* 'Home municipality classification' is not an easily understood name for the phenomenon we refer to; another term needs to be used. And this is also a good example of a measure that I need to motivate better why it is important to include; What will these municipality classifications tell us? Also, should we really include all nine categories? It is quiet much considering that we are mainly interested in how the urban vs. rural influence on awareness, attitudes and willingness. Furthermore: Is the distribution typical of Sweden? – A good reason to include such a measure would otherwise be as a means to understand better how representative the sample is of the general (60+) population. Even though that this is something that then would be brought up in the discussion rather than here, I should bear that in mind when bringing the measure up here. 

* It was decided (in dialogue with SI as well who dropped in to listen to discussion towards the end) that in this study we will not include 'Motivations and obstacles related to public involvement in research'. Rather, it will have to be the subject of another study.

* As of the measure of the preferred kind of research involvement of respondents willing to be actively involved, it is currently introduced in the methods secton in the following way:

  > In order to find out the preferred kind of research involvement of respondents willing to be actively involved, these participants were also asked to take a stand on the statement “If you were given the opportunity, how likely is it that you would like to participate by...” followed by six different examples of active involvement such as “being part of a user council, reference group, board or the like?” and an open answer option. Participants were here assigned five response options ranging from "Not at all" to "Very much".

  However, SS rightly pointed out that this measure does not - as of now - connect to any of the research question for the study. In dialogue with SI, we agreed though that this measure is still highly relevant for the focus of the study BUT it should be moved to the descriptives section rather then put here.

3.7 - Måste kolla om att man har fyllt 'Övrigt' här om det verkligen är aktivt deltagande.

- Put "Have you been actively involved.." as a confounder

- Bivariate analysis was skipped. Should it be included? Maybe since it is not so theoretically-driven. With co-variates...
- In an explanatory analysis it could be good

Do a bivariate analysis for each of the predictive variables towards the dependent variable.

Susanne Ullén -- a statistician that can be contacted once I get a grip of the material. She can help has with the validity. Book a meeting with her together with Steven (and Susanne) - book an online meeting with her now. She needs about two weeks notice in advance. Book 1-1.5 hour with her.
