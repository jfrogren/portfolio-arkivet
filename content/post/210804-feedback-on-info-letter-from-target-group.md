Just over a week ago, I sent the proposed information letter for study III (which is intended to go out to association members and which I have produced in dialogue with MG, OJ and SI) to a handful of selected people from the target group. The proposed mail text looked initially like [this](https://lu.app.box.com/file/848058220981) and after some feedback like [this](https://lu.app.box.com/file/848059061074). After correspondence both via email and by telephone, the feedback I received can be summarized as follows:

It was partly about the fact that it was not clear enough that *Bostadsförsöket* and *Evaluation of Bostadsförsöket* were two different things. In addition, clarifications were requested that the evaluation study consisted of two parts. Furthermore, the language was considered to contain unnecessarily complicated words such as *funktionsrättsrörelsen*. In addition, the sentences were in many cases considered too long and thus difficult to read. I will now take this into account and draft a new proposal which I will send to OJ, MG and SI for final comments.
