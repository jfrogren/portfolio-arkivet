Today I got the manuscript back from SI with some feedback. She also sent me a guide on how to write an academic discussion:

* SI's feedback in [a personal mail](https://lu.app.box.com/file/837457586548) and in [a commented manuscript](https://lu.app.box.com/file/837457720894)
* SI's [guide](https://lu.app.box.com/file/837459164245) on how to write a discussion
