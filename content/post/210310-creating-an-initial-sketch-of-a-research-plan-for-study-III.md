Today, I sent [my draft of a research plan](/210310/research-plan-for-study-III-exported.html) (as part of the work on an ethical application) for study III to MG and OJ. We will discuss it further on Friday morning (210312).

In addition, MG sent me [her sketch](/210310/MGs-draft.pdf) of (mainly) survey questions to include and OJ sent me [his draft](/210310/OJs-draft.pdf) of suggested methodology description and survey questions. OJ also sent a ["mellanhandsinbjudan"](/210310/inbjudan-av-mellanhand-for-userage-studie.pdf) used when contacting the boards of pensionist associations (with the wish that they in turn contact their members) for another project. It can be used as an inspiration when writing the letter we intend to write.
