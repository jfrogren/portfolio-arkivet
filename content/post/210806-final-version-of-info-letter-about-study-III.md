After feedback from the handful of representatives from the target group I used and occasional comments from MG, OJ and SI, I have now produced a final version of the information letter that is intended to go out from the associations to their members at the beginning of next week. [This](https://lu.app.box.com/file/848063159266) is how it turned out...

Next week I will find out what the reminders to be sent out should look like.
