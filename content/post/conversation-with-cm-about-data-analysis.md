Had a conversation with CM over zoom about her data analysis procedure and about logistic regression in particular. In order to illustrate her he send some images of what she has been creating in SPSS as art of her data analysis procedure. 

## Logistic regression table 

![Here](/images/201210-cms-logistic-regression-table) is the first image and it shows the output of a logistic regression in SPSS, I suppose.

![Here](/images/201210-cms-logistic-regression-table) is how she linked the different variables to 'willingness' through a logistic regression.
