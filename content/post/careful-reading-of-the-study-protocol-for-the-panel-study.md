Did a careful reading of [the study protocol](/pdfs/kylen2020.pdf) for the panel study and took some [notes](https://github.com/jfrogren/bibnotes/blob/master/kylen2020.md) as I was reading. There is clearly som ambiguity when it comes to "knowledge users" and who we mean are included in this group. See notes for more detail.
