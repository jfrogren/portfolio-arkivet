Barely a week before the meeting, I had emailed the following version of the manuscript to the co-authors:
* [Manuscript version of Study IV mailed out to co-authors](https://lu.app.box.com/file/913732456690) 

I had also attached [a file with the survey results](https://lu.app.box.com/file/913733624435) and written [this text](https://lu.app.box.com/file/913734662111) in the mail that I sent out. 

In the following version, comments from the meeting itself are included directly in the manuscript:
* [Feedback during manuscript meeting](https://lu.app.box.com/file/913737610824) on my manuscript for Study IV
 
Below is the written feedback I received from one of the co-authors:
