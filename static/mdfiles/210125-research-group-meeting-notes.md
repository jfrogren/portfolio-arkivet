# Notes from Research-group meeting 25 November 2021

## 1. Update on COVID-19 restrictions, physical and psychosocial working conditions

A discussion held about how people feel and think about the covid situation. SI said that maybe the PhD students who started their PhD about the time when the Covid situation appeared, suffered the most since they to a larger extent had missed out when it comes to getting to know their colleagues and finding their way around in relation to doctoral studies and what was expected of them and how things should be done.  

### Outlook calender
We decided to continue with the calenders filling in our physical presence in Outlook.

### Online fika 
Discussion if we should continue this? As of now, typically 5-6 persons participate and it more or less the same crowd every time. SE will keep scheduling them once  aweek or so, but SE will not be the host. She will just put up the link.

### Research group meetings
We will continue with short Research-group-meetings once a month from now on.

## 2. Challenges for the basic and advanced level education programmes and requests for additional teaching efforts

SI informed us that from a faculty and level there has been a call for more teaching capacity in Occupational Therapy but also in other subjects such as Statistics, Public Health, etc. 

SI reached out with a question on how we as a research-group should contribute to try to work towards a solution to the problem. 

JO asked if teachers in other subject as well. MG said that ther may be need for  physiotherapists as well but pointed out that is important that there a re two sides to the problem, One that is more urgent right now, and one that is more long-term and sustainable in the long run. SI will have further meeting with the responsible for this in order to get a more complete picture of what the real problem is and how we together can work towards a solution. There seemed to be from the faculty or department level  abit of annoyance, but SI pointed out that in order for us to "do our duty" as teachers, we also need to get the proper resources for doing it.
