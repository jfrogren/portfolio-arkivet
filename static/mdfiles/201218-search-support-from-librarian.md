The overarching aim was to investigate the awareness and attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among 60+ citizens in Sweden.
One specific aim was to report descriptive results regarding awareness and attitudes. Focusing on willingness to be actively involved in research on ageing and health, another specific aim was to investigate its relationship with demographics and health.

The analysis for the second specific aim was guided by the following research question: How do the willingness of 60+ citizens to be actively involved in research on ageing and health relate to sex, age, economic situation, level of education and perceived health?

### Poli A, Kelfve S, Klompstra L, Strömberg A, Jaarsma T, Motel-Klingebiel A Prediction of (Non)Participation of Older People in Digital Health Research: Exergame Intervention Study J Med Internet Res 2020;22(6):e17884

> "Results indicate that selective nonparticipation takes place in digital health research (in this case the HF-Wii study that  evaluated the impact of exergaming on the exercise capacity and daily physical activity of patients with HF. Exergame is a term that refers to video games that can beused for exercising, often at home).. and that it is associated with age and symptom severity. Gender effects cannot be proven. Such systematic selection can lead to biased research results that inappropriately inform research, policy, and practice."

Men vad menas egentligen med "selective nonparticipation"? Är det forskningsledare som avstår från att tillfråga eller är det människor som pga sitt hälsotillstånd avstår från att vara med? Det är ju en väsentlig skillnad.


### Bindels, J., Baur, V., Cox, K., Heijing, S., & Abma, T. (2014). Older people as co-researchers: a collaborative journey. Ageing Soc, 34(6), 951-973.

En artikel som på ett mer ingående sätt beskriver hur det kan te sig att låta äldre personer agera medforskare. Slutsatsen är att det finns fördomar som florerar åt båda håll mellan forskare och äldre personer men att 'interim reflection meetings' kan vara ett fruktbart sätt att komma till bukt med dem och också ett fruktbart sätt att skapa en ömsesidig förståelse och därigenom utvecklas tillsammans.

> Interim reflection meetings – at which mutual expectations were expressed along with a frank discussion of prejudices, tasks and role divisions, and the sharing of personal and project-related needs and information – were found to be fruitful in achieving a positive working relationship and fostering an effective collaboration. We conclude that a learning perspective on participation can be a resource for learning and adaptive change.

Dessutom ger den i inledning en omfattande motivering till varför äldre personer bör inkluderas i forskning på detta sätt. Det handlar med hänvisning till en viss Walker (2007) om två orsaker: en 'epistemologisk' och en 'ontologisk' och här finns kopplingar till Frickers begrepp. Epistemologiskt handlar det om att...

> Older people have a specific perspective concerning ageing and service use, which is based on and informed by their experiential knowledge. This knowledge is gained through the daily experiences of older people with their own ageing and the care they receive. Furthermore, older people may have concerns about interventions in health care which go overlooked by policy makers and researchers. [2]

Alltså om äldres unika kunskap och erfarenhet som det krävs att äldre själva delar med forskare i någon form för att den ska kunna upptas och tas i beaktande av forskare. Här hänvisar Bindels et al. till tidigare forskning som visat att:

> - older people’s understanding is needed to attune ageing research agendas and methods, to better address their needs, and the ﬁndings are more likely and better able to enhance the quality of their lives (Davies and Nolan 2003)

> - The blending of scientiﬁc knowledge with experiential knowledge in ageing research is slowly becoming more accepted as a means of increasing the practical relevance of research and validating the research process and its findings (Reed, Stanley and Clarke 2004).

När det kommer till den ontologiska anledningen att involvera äldre personer i forskning skriver Bindels et al. så här: 

> A second, ontological reason for the involvement of older people in research concerns their rights as citizens to influence decisions which could affect their lives in the long term, and the need to further social justice and human rights in the context of power differences between people (Carter and Beresford 2000; Mertens 2009). This argument is particularly strong with regard to older people because of their experiences of age discrimination, marginalisation in society and other forms of social exclusion (Walker 2007). It is not a question of whether to involve older people, but how and to what extent.

Här är det alltså en fråga om medborgerliga rättigheter att få vara med att påverka de beslut som påverkar en, och här skrivs uttryckligen med hänvisning till Walker (2007) att äldre personer är utsatta för åldersdiskriminering, marginalisering i samhället och andra former av exkludering. 

Detta är starka argument för att äldre personer ska delta aktivt i forskning om åldrande och hälsa, men görs detta då? Nej, inte enligt Bindels et al.:

> Although older people form the core business constituency for many health-care organisations, they are often excluded from clinical trials. This is a side effect of the age and protocol restrictions that are used to create homogeneous study populations (McMurdo, Witham and Gillespie 2005). Researchers are afraid, moreover, that the enrolment of older people will cost more time and will require more expertise and work-hours due to issues such as hearing and visual impairments (Habicht, Witham and McMurdo 2008).

I kvalitativt inriktad forskning utgörs det vanliga deltagandet av en form av passivt deltagande där äldre personer inte ges möjlighet att påverka forskningsprocessen:

> In qualitative research, including older people in research as respondents in interviews or as focus group participants is the most common form of participation. The older person has no direct influence on the research process when such methods are used.

Men frågan är hur stort inflytande äldre personer egentligen har att påverka utformandet av våra studier? 

Enligt Bindels et al. vad utmärker då ett mer aktivt deltagande? Jo, så här skriver de:

> In order to genuinely involve older people in the research process and to honestly collaborate with them, one needs to go further; older people can become advisors, interviewers, co-researchers or even initiators of research (Abma and Broerse 2010).

Den form av engagemang de söker är alltså att äldre personer i forskningsstudier ska utgöra rådgivare, intervjuare, medforskare (co-researchers) eller till och med initiativtagare.

Så här definieras medforskare (co-researcher):

> Co-researchers in ageing research are older people who collaborate on an equal basis with academic researchers in research teams. Older people can use their experiential knowledge in conversation with the researchers, thereby actively influencing the research process, for example by co-developing the research design. Both the academic researcher and the co-researcher have access to speciﬁc forms of knowledge, be it scientific or experiential; both can thus be seen as experts. The acknowledgement of the older person as an expert forms the basis for an equal relationship between co-researchers and professional researchers (Abma and Broerse 2010; Abma, Nierse and Widdershoven 2009). [3]

Har sådana typ av studier bedrivits där äldre personer deltagit på detta sätt? Ja, Bindels et al. ger exempel på två studier (Reed et al. 2002 & Cornes, Peardon and Manthorphe 2008) och skriver att:

> Both studies describe how research collaboration with older people can have great beneﬁts for researchers, older people and services. In collaborating with end users in research, however, special attention should be paid to empowerment and equal relationships. [3]

Vad utmärker då 'equal relationships' och 'equality' i detta sammanhang? Jo, så här skriver Bindels et al.:

> Equality should be achieved by allowing every team member [3] to exercise, improve and develop different skills, and thereby position themselves to maximum efficacy within the team (Cornes, Peardon and Manthorpe 2008). [4]  

Alltså att ge varandra förutsättningar att öva upp och förbättra sina förmågor. En smula vagt kanske, eftersom det är lite för allmänt formulerat för att gå att visualisera tydligt.

När det kommer till det omtalade begreppet 'representation' så skriver Bindels et al. så här:

> Representation is a much-debated issue in the field of public participation. A distinction drawn by Warburton and Petriwskyj (2007) describes two bases upon which older people can act as legitimate representatives – they either have experiential knowledge on ageing or they are members of organisations which represent older people.

Allså antingen har de "experiential knowledge on ageing" (vem har inte det?) eller är medlemmar av en organisation som representerar äldre personer. Men räcker det verkligen? Jag förstår tanken ämligen att man antingen representerar sin egen erfarenhet eller andras samlade erfarenhet men är inte de representanter vi söker inom UserAge en kombination, och vad säger att bara för att man har 'check' på någon av dessa boxar utgör en lämplig representant? Återigen är ju det lite vagt formulerat, men man får väl gå till den artikel som det hänvisas till för att få bättre svar.

När det kommer till vilka UTMANINGAR som föreligger skriver Bindels et al så här:

> Working together with co-researchers, however, is often a new and challenging task for professional researchers and involves a mutual learning process (Nierse and Abma 2011; Nierse et al. 2011; Schipper et al. 2010).

Detta är en bra referens att använda för att denna form av forskning a) är utmanande; b) innehåller en ömsesidig lärandeprocess.

Vidare skriver Bindels et al. att denna typ av forskning ERBJUDER MÖJLIGHETER FÖR UTVECKLING för co-researchers, vilket också kan vara bra att kunna referera till. Så här formulerar de det:

> Involvement also creates possibilities for personal development on the part of the older people. It can enhance older people’s self-esteem and their social contacts (Barnes and Bennett 1998). Reed, Weiner and Cook (2004) found that older people enjoyed the learning opportunities that working with experienced professionals afforded them.

Vad finns det för 'aber' då? Jo, till att börja med att kompetensen för att bedriva denna sortens forskning saknas för att forska tillsammans med äldre personer:

> Even if goodwill exists among professionals, they may lack the competencies needed to foster effective research collaborations with older people (Fudge, Wolfe and McKevitt 2007).

Och att äldre personer kan vara tveksamma att delta av oro för att deras deltagande endast är 'tokenistic':

> Older people themselves can, moreover, have reservations about acting as a co-researcher in a research team. Older people expressed the concern that their participation may be tokenistic (Cornes, Peardon and Manthorpe 2008).

Vidare kan de sterotyper och negativa föreställningar som föreligger kring åldrande hämma äldre personer från att delta:

> According to Thompson and Thompson (2001), older people are less likely to become active participants because of the many stereotypes and negative conceptions that exist about ageing.

Vidare kan det handla om att svårigheter att röra sig och skörhet kan hindra äldre personer från att delta:

> Mobility difficulties and frailty can further inhibit older people from fully participating at meetings and in research activities (Thompson and Thompson 2001).

Vidare har forskning visat att patienter med reumatiska besvär kan hysa en rädsla för att deras bidrag till forskningen inte är användbara/ kommer till nytta:

> Kirwan et al. (2005), who co-developed and managed a range of research projects within the ﬁeld of rheumatology with co-researchers, found that some patients were afraid their contributions to the research would not be useful.

En annan farhåga som hämmar viljan att delta kan vara att patienter inte anser sig ha tillräcklig förståelse för vetenskapliga och medicinska begrepp:

> Furthermore, patients may fear that they do not possess sufficient understanding of scientiﬁc or medical terms (Kirwan et al. 2005).

Det är också, menar Bindels et al. en farhåga som inte helt är tagen ur luften eftersom det visat sig att även när forskare använder sig av medvetna inkluderande strategier kan det ändå vara så att patienter och medforskare inte känner sig inkluderade i processen:

> Caron-Flinterman and Broerse (2010) found that, even when researchers deliberately used inclusionary strategies, patients or co-researchers may not feel included in the process.

'patient engagement research' = ännu ett begrepp, syftar till att 'to incentivize patients to become more engaged in their health and health care.' (p.1058)

När det kommer till vilka hinder som anses föreliggar för att patienter ska kunna engagera sig mer i forskning eller annorlunda formulerat inta en mer aktiv roll i forskning pratar artikelförfattarna här om att det är en fråga om maktstrukturer mellan patienter, vårdgivare och forskare. På vilket sätt dessa maktstrukturer ter sig skrivs inte ut så explicit men det lämnas en referens till en studie av Domecq et al. från 2014 i form av en systematisk review kring 'Patient engagement in research'. Och de mer konkreta hinder som nämns och som kan kopplas till makt är a) att patienter behöver förberedas för att delta i forskning; b) att vetenskapliga tidskrifter måste bli mer mottagliga för artiklar "written in a patient voice" och att blir bättre på att tillgängligagöra artiklarna så att de blir tillgängliga för olika sorters publik:

> The development of engagement research in health has been difficult to achieve because of the long-standing power differentials between patients and care providers and researchers [4]. Some of the particular barriers to engagement have been identified: the need to prepare patients to engage in research; the need for journals to be open to including articles written in a patient voice and to make these bridge articles available through open access to a number of audiences [p. 1058]

Mycket av forskningen inom området har varit inriktad på att dokumentera och definiera (graden av) detta engagemang:

> Much of the work to date on patient engagement in research has focused on documenting and defining patient engagement/involvement/activation that consider; when engagement takes place, the degree of engagement, what activities patients engage in, who is involved, and the processes used [8–11]. These definitions are fluid and depend on the country, the system, the funding formats or the disciplines or domains under study.

I artikeln konstateras detta och jag antar att det är en form av kritik och att artikelförfattarna anser att det är mer relevant att forska kring metoder för 'hur' man ska involvera snarare än att försöka klassificera graden av engagemang, men det är min tolkning.


### Mey, E., & van Hoven, B. (2019). Managing expectations in participatory research involving older people: what’s in it for whom?. International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 22(3), 323-334.

- Här används begreppet 'participatory research involving older people'

Det argumenteras för denna typ av forskning mot bakgrund av att:
- WHO som en konsekvens av trycket från urbanisering + den åldrande befolkningen betonar vikten av 'age-friendly cities' + promotandet av en 'ageing-in-place' approach.

Detta har gjort att ageing-in-place policies har tagits fram i syfte att...

> to provide formal and informal support, familiarity and predictability and addressing independence and wellbeing (Wiles, Leibing, Guberman, Reeve, & Allen, 2012; Lager, van Hoven, & Huigen, 2013; Theunissen & van Hoven, 2018). [323]

Men...

> the ways in which older people experience their neighbourhood do not always align with the operationalization of ageing-in-place policies in neighbourhoods (Lager et al., 2013)." [323]

Med andra ord: En top-down approach verkar inte vara tillräcklig eller rätt sätt att gå tillväga för att skapa de miljöer man eftersträvar. Så hur gå tillväga? Jo, det har gjorts lovande försök med en annan approach..

> In recent years some governments have been adapting their approach to ageing policies by employing bottom-up strategies to policy development, actively engaging policy subjects – older people in this case – and giving them a stronger voice in policy negotiation. Tine Buffel’s (2015) participatory research with older adults in Manchester provides an interesting and engaging example of local government- research collaboration. [323]

Det är utifrån Tine Buffels sätt att bedriva forskning med äldre personer som artikelförfattarna alltså argumenterar för 'participatory research involving older people'. Hur definieras du 'participatory research' i detta fall? Jo, så här:

> Participatory research actively engages participants in some or all stages of the research process – from deciding on scope and problem statement to actively collecting data to disseminating results and effecting change (see Pain, 2004; Pain & Francis, 2003; Pain & Kindon, 2007; Walker, 2007) thus involving ‘end users’ in the research from an early stage. Through involvement as co-researchers in the participatory research process, older people are potentially given a voice [323] in debates on relevant issues in order to influence decisions and negotiate change (Bindels, Baur,Cox, Heijing, & Abma, 2014; Pain & Kindon, 2007). [324]

Här ligger fokus på att ge äldre personer en röst i debatter i syfte att de ska ges makten att kunna påverka beslut och förhandla om förändringar. 

Den här typ av forskning ställer andra krav på forskaren som i viss mån antar en annan roll:

> Such an approach entails that what is being asked of the traditional academic researcher changes from an extractive and analytical approach to a more managing, collaborative and action-oriented approach (Blair & Minkler., 2009; Kindon, Pain, & Kesby, 2008). [324]

Vidare är kanske inte den kunskapen som produceras helt i linje med den empiriska data som normalt tas fram inom forskning och därför svår att få att passa in i en vetenskaplig analys:

> considering the aims of participatory research pertain predominantly to engaging local populations and initiating action, the knowledge produced may not necessarily align with the type of empirical data fitted for scientiﬁc analysis (Littlechild, Tanner, & Hall, 2015; Pain & Kindon, 2007).

Det föreligger alltså en svårighet i det att rollerna förändras och den kunskap man får fram är svår att få att passa in i den traditionella vetenskapliga mallen.

Detta är också syftet med denna artikel att utifrån ett visst fall diskutera rollfördelning och vilken slags kunskap som fås fram när man arbetar på detta sätt. Så här skriver de:

> Drawing on a university initiated participatory study involving older people as co-researchers in a neighbourhood in Groningen, the Netherlands, this paper discusses the shifting roles and expectations of all of those involved in the participatory research process. We address expectations and aims of those involved; resources required to successfully complete the project; and different outcomes to those involved. [324]

Dessförinnan går de dock igenom 'participatory research', vad det innebär, vad man bör tänka på och vilka farhågor det finns med denna typ av approach inom forskning. Först och främst beskriver de att 'participatory research' kännetecknas av en flexibel och adaptiv process som syftar till lokal förändring, och med andra ord ställs delvis andra krav på forskaren som förväntas vara mer flexibel och göra mer 'practical investment' (vad nu det innebär) jämfört med en vanlig forskningsprocess:

> Participatory research is characterized by a flexible and adaptive process directed at local change through a high degree of engagement with participants during and after the research endeavor (Kindon et al., 2008; Pain & Francis, 2003). As noted, intensive participant engagement requires a different, more flexible and practical investment from the researcher compared with a more traditional research process.

Artikelförfattarna argumenterar för att 'participatory research' kan argumenteras för genom att approachen har potential att (jämfört med sedvanlig forskning) åstadkomma:
- mer inkludering
- högre relevans
- rikare data
- empowerment (för co-researchers)
- åstadkomma förändring ('effecting change')

Så här ser argumenten ut

#### Mer inkludering 
Genom att aktivt involvera den lokala befolkningen och få möjligheten att få åtkomst till deras lokala sociala nätverk och resurser kan fler människor nås och möjligheten att inkludera marginaliserade grupper "(e.g. children, youths, ethnic minorities or people with disabilities (see Pain, 2004))" [324] som annars kan vara svåra att nå, utökas. Dessutom finns potential genom denna metod att skapa "inclusive accounts of local knowledge – giving voice to participants in their own words (Pain & Francis, 2003)." [324]

#### Högre relevans

> Especially if researched populations are approached and engaged in the earliest stages of the research process, where questions and goals have yet to be formulated, the project will gain relevance and legitimacy because the voices of the researched give direction to the research (Littlechild et al., 2015). [324]


##### Rikare data
> ...co-researchers, because of their shared characteristics and experiences have the ability to communicate and relate to interviewees more closely. This is found to have a positive effect on the richness of data produced (Ellins et al., 2012). [324]

> older co-researchers are able to converse and empathize with the interviewee, which makes the interviewee feel more at ease to share more and richer information (Littlechild et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2006; Warren & Cook, 2005). [324]

> Involving co-researchers in subsequent research stages such as data analysis, may enhance the academic researcher’s understanding of the data collected (Miller et al., 2006). [324]

##### Empowerment (för co-researchers)

Vad menas med 'empowerment'? Jo, med stöd ifrån ett flertal författare (av vetenskapliga artiklar) beskriver de empowerment så här:

> a means for social transformation, where participants are equipped with the awareness and knowledge on factors and processes shaping their social lives on which they can base social and political action (Bindels et al., 2014; Kindon et al., 2008; Macaulay et al., 1999) [325]

Empowerment sker i participatory research genom en 'co-learning process' där medforskarna inte bara bidrar med kunskap utan även använder den förvärvade kunskapen lokalt efter forskningeprojektets slut och därigenom förmår bli empowered:

> Blair & Minkler (2009, p. 652) describe the participatory research process as a ‘co-learning process’ where participants not only learn by doing, but also contribute to the knowledge produced and later use that knowledge in the community setting, long after the research project has finished. [325]

##### Åstadkomma förändring ('effecting change')

> Closely connected to the promise of community empowerment, local populations through acquired knowledge and skills are able to effect change through political or social action (Kindon et al., 2008; Mayan & Daum, 2016; Pain & Francis, 2003). Buffel’s (2015) participatory research provides examples of how older co-researches are able to draw on their own experience of ageing in a neighbourhood enabling them to address the challenges and opportunities in developing age-friendly policies.


#### Fallgroparna för participatorisk forskning

> Even the best-intentioned and well-executed participatory projects often fail to deliver on the promises of participatory research (Pain & Francis, 2003, p. 48). [325]

Det finns många fallgropar och i artikeln listas (några av) dessa:

##### Knowledge produced is negotiated by interests and skills and thus need critical examination

> ...the production of knowledge in participatory research is heavily negotiated through interests and skills of researchers and participants (Pain, 2004). Therefore, it is pertinent to subject the knowledge claims deriving from participatory research to critical examination (Littlechild et al., 2015; Bindels et al. 2014). [325]

##### Co-researchers profound impact on research process needs to be taken into consideration
> ...co-researchers have a profound impact on the choices made and directions taken in the research process, influencing the quality, nature and representativeness of data, which has to be taken into consideration (Littlechild et al., 2015). [325]

##### Perceived understanding between interviewer and respondents may be a threat to data quality
> ...perceived understanding between interviewer and respondents can also pose a threat to data quality because the respondent may not elaborate on topics s/he feels the interview is already familiar with by personal experience (Littlechild et al., 2015; Staley, Buckland, Hayes, & Tarpey, 2014). [325]

##### Power relations may be same as in top-down research
> ...power in participatory research can potentially be distributed in such a way that power relations do not differ from extractive or top-down research approaches (Kindon et al., 2008). [325]

##### Labeling a study participatory can violate expectations and trust of participants
> ...Labeling a study participatory – perhaps consciously for the appearance of legitimacy and inclusion, or merely ‘ticking the participation box’ (Rose, 2003, p. 405) – while it is in fact extractive, can seriously violate expectations and trust of participants (Pain, 2004). [325]

##### PR may legitimize elite knowledge and reproduce inequalities it seeks to challenge
> ...co-researchers that are engaged can potentially represent but a small or elite group in the studied population, therefore legitimizing elite knowledge, rather than inclusive layperson’s knowledge (Bindels et al., 2014; Kindon et al., 2008). In so doing, participatory research might actually reproduce the inequalities that it seeks to challenge (Buﬀel, 2015). [325]

##### Presence of academic researchers might cause a lack of confidence in co-researchers
> Bindels et al. (2014) point out that the presence of academic researchers might be perceived as intimidating, causing a lack of confidence in co-researchers in terms of contributing to and engaging with the research. [325]

##### Positivist-oriented journals tend to disregard participatory research findings as too subjective and specific

> ...positivist-oriented journals tend to disregard participatory research findings as too subjective and specific (Bindels et al., 2014) [326]

##### Potential difficulties related to transferring participatory research findings into practice need to be acknowledged

> Ellis et al. (2012) remark that their qualitative evidence was not found particularly suitable to translate into policy instruments (see also Theunissen & van Hoven, 2018). The difficulties related to transferring participatory research findings into practice and policy highlight, as vital requirements for effecting actual change, the importance of a mandate and the skill to translate qualitative evidence into policy and practical measure. Therefore, participatory researchers must maintain a careful self-reﬂexive apprehension of negotiations and choices made during the process. [326]


Här följer en rad andra fallgropar som framkom specifikt för denna studie och som kan ses som några av de vetenskapliga bidrag som studien kommer med:

##### Research fatigue 

> In the early stages of the Vinkhuizen project, the researchers encountered a form of research fatigue (see Clark, 2008) due to the high number of studies already laid out by municipal organizations and the two educational institutions adjacent to the neighbourhood, which caused a reluctance to participate among older neighbourhood residents. [332]

##### The importance to align expectations from the get-go and to carefully and continuously communicate and manage expectations in all stages of the research.

> Besides research fatigue, another factor inhibiting willingness to participate was a lack of clarity as to the role division between participating parties. The researchers envisioned their role in the formulation of goals and aims of the project to be a leading one, providing local older residents with a sense of ownership and empowerment. However, to the co-researchers it seemed that the scope of the research was already set before they were approached – which in fact was the case. Therefore, in their eyes, the project belonged to the UG researchers in which they took the facilitating role of co-researcher. This highlights a tension – encountered in other participatory research as well (see Littlechild et al., 2015; Trell, van Hoven, & Huigen, 2014) – between co-researcher empowerment and the academic researcher’s inclination to plan and control the research aims and quality of data produced (see also Kindon et al., 2008). While these tensions are widely encountered in participatory research, they are diﬃcult to resolve to every party’s satisfaction and consequently end up in trade-oﬀs between e.g. data quality and co-researcher or community empowerment. Therefore, we recommend co-researchers and academic researchers explicitly and continuously engage in dialogues to negotiate and determine expectations across the research process and thereafter. Underlining the importance of this recommendation is our description of how discrepancies in expectations on these issues in early stages of the research carried into subsequent stages of the research, causing a much more intensive role of the UG researchers than was envisioned and the prolonging of the project (Bindels et al., 2014). This process highlights the importance to align expectations from the get-go and to carefully and continuously communicate and manage expectations in all stages of the research. [332]

##### To effect a degree of change requires sufficient money and time which a research project might not be able to allocate
> The management of expectations ties into the coordination of resources made available. One of the promises of the project, and participatory research in general was to effect a degree of change (Bindels 2013, Pain, 2004; Pain & Francis, 2003; Pain & Kindon, 2007; Walker, 2007). The promise of change is also one of the conditions that compells co-researchers to participate. However, without the ﬁnancial and time budget to give substance to this promise, the participatory project runs the risks of violating participants’ expectations. [332]


> ...While Blazek and Hraňová (2012) and Pain et al. (2011) assert the notion that research impact actually occurs during the research process rather than exclusively in disseminating stages of the research, it was clear our co-researchers viewed eﬀecting change as impact through interventions based on research results. [333]

Det föregående citatet väcker en intressant fråga kring var fokus bör ligga i participatorisk forskning. Handlar det om att i processen som sådan åstadkomma förändring och att det är kunskapsutbytet i sig som skapar förändringen eller handlar det om att efter processen implementera den kunskap som man har tagit fram? 

### Serrat, R., Scharf, T., Villar, F., & Gómez, C. (2020). Fifty-five years of research into older people’s civic participation: Recent trends, future directions. The Gerontologist, 60(1), e38-e51.

Här pratas det om 'civic participation'. Vad innebär det?

Här påtalas att det finns en systematisk review om "motivations for and barriers to volunteering (Principi, Chiatti, Lamura, & Frerichs, 2012)" kopplat till older adults' civic participation. 

Det finns också en systematisk review kopplat till "benefits of volunteering in terms of physical and mental health (Jenkinson et al., 2013)."

Dock saknas en "scoping review" där kunskap kring detta område gås igenom och samlas. Artikeln har ett tvåfaldigt syfte:

> first, to analyze critically existing knowledge concerning older people’s civic participation, and second, to pinpoint knowledge gaps and propose new directions for research.

#### Vad är 'civic participation'?

> Referring to activities “…outside the own family and circle of close friends” (Ekman & Amnå, 2012, p. 291), civic participation can be described as active citizen participation “… in the life of a community in order to improve conditions for others or to help shape the community’s future” (Adler & Goggin, 2005, p. 241). [e38]

Det är med andra ord inte samma sak som att delta aktivt i forskning utan syftar mer på ett engagemang som de facto förändrar på ett lokalt och direkt sätt. Dock kan det ju finnas paralleller mellan vilka som engagerar sig på detta sätt och folk som vill engagera sig aktivt i forskning. Tycker dock att det fortfarande är något oklart. Att engagera sig i en bostadsrättsförening, är det civic participation till exempel?

#### Civic participation vs. Civic engagement (or involvement or attention)

> First, there is a differentiation between civic engagement (or involvement or attention) and civic participation. Although civic engagement simply denotes psychological attentiveness to social and political issues, participation conveys the idea of action and must be conceived as behavioral in nature.

Alltså är participation inte bara kognitivt utan innefattar ett verkligt handlande.

#### Varför engagerar sig vissa på detta sätt och andra inte?

> Research on antecedents considers why some older people participate in civic activities whereas others do not. Factors associated with civic participation studied thus far include higher human and social capital resources (e.g., McNamara & Gonzales, 2011), personality variables such as higher extraversion (e.g., Mike, Jackson, & Oltmanns, 2014), or simultaneous engagement in other active aging pursuits []

#### Older people’s experiences of participation

> There is growing interest in aspects such as the meanings that participants attach to participation (e.g., Lilburn, Breheny, & Pond, 2018)...

>...or the experiential learning processes that occur within organizations (e.g., Piercy, Cheek, & Teemant, 2011).

#### The effects of civic participation on people who participate.

> civic participation has been associated with better physical and mental health (e.g., Lum & Lightfoot, 2005), higher cognitive function (e.g., Proulx et al., 2018), lower mortality risk (e.g., Okun, Yeung, & Brown, 2013), higher well-being (e.g., Kahana, Bhatta, Lovegreen, Kahana, & Midlarsky, 2013), increased physical activity (e.g., Varma et al., 2016), or decreased loneliness (e.g., Carr et al., 2018).

#### The importance of considering both who participates and where and when civic participation occurs

> When studying this issue among older people, regardless of the stage of the participation process addressed, previous literature highlights the importance of considering both who participates and where and when civic participation occurs. 

> First, older people’s civic participation may be understood from the perspective of diversity. As a group, older people encompass considerable diversity in terms of “… gender, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, health status, need for assistance with personal and domestic care, class, political persuasion, work and life experience” (Barnes, 2005, p. 257). This diversity influences who is able to participate in civic activities, as barriers for participation vary according to older people’s embodied, cultural, and socioeconomic characteristics (Petriwskyj et al., 2017), in which ways they are able to participate, as gender shapes the civic roles expected for older men and women (Nesteruk & Price, 2011), and what benefits accrue from participation, as these vary according to older people’s socioeconomic status (Morrow-Howell, Hong, & Tang, 2009). 

> Second, older people’s civic participation is shaped by the sociopolitical contexts in which participation occurs (Goerres, 2009). Cross-national research (e.g., Haski-Leventhal, 2009) highlights the importance of understanding context when addressing older people’s civic participation.

#### Slutsatser från studien

> research into older people’s civic participation has grown steadily over the past 55 years, and particularly during the last two decades. This reflects a growing interest in academic research in promoting active and successful ways of aging, which echoes policy and practice recommendations by major international organizations (e.g., United Nations, 2002).

##### 1. A need to broaden the scope of research into older people's civic participation

###### Informell civic participation behöver uppvärderas och forskas om mer
> although informal helping behaviors are the most common forms of older people’s civic participation (e.g., Kruse & Schmitt, 2015), our review demonstrates that they have received the least attention in research. This may be due, in part, to the fact that informal helping behaviors could be more difficult to study, as they tend to occur in a more private sphere in comparison to other civic activities, but especially because these behaviors have been barely included within the most prominent models of active and successful aging (e.g., de São José, Timonen, Amado, & Santos, 2017), even if they are of greater importance for older people than other activities commonly included within these models (e.g., Huijg et al., 2017).


###### Older people are not just social actors but also political agents
> research into older people’s civic participation has favored a conception of older people as “contributors” to sustaining welfare states rather than as “political activists” who may challenge the social and political processes underlying welfare states (e.g., Martinson & Minkler, 2006).

> ...we need to move beyond conceiving of older people as social actors and consider them simultaneously as political agents, as a collective whose voices and opinions must be acknowledged in decision-making processes.

#### 2. A need to address contextual aspects of older people's civic participation

> ...contextual aspects of civic participation remain underdeveloped at three levels. [e47]

##### Microcontextual level
> First, at the microcontextual level, we need more research addressing organizational dimensions of participation. An emerging body of studies suggests that organizations play an important role in such aspects as the recruitment and retention of older participants (e.g., Devaney et al., 2015) or the benefits individuals obtain from participation (e.g., Hong & Morrow-Howell, 2013).

##### Mesocontextual level

> The work of Dury, Willems, and colleagues (2016) shows that older people’s perceptions of physical and social dimensions of neighborhood as well as objective municipality features are associated with participation in formal volunteering in later life. However, this mesocontextual dimension remains under-researched, emphasizing the considerable potential to develop new studies concerning neighborhood and community influences on civic participation in later life. [e47]

##### Macrocontextual level

> there is a need for more evidence drawn from countries other than the United States, and especially for cross-cultural research comparing older people’s civic participation across diverse sociopolitical contexts. [e47]

#### 3. A need to explore how participation develops

> older people’s experiences while participating in civic activities are far less addressed than antecedents or outcomes of participation. Such experiences are important in understanding, for example, individuals’ decisions around continuing or withdrawing from participation (e.g., Tang, Morrow-Howell, & Hong, 2009). [e47]

>...more studies should explore older people’s experiences of civic participation, and also the role of these experiences on individuals’ decisions to stop or continue participating. [e47]

> ...most previous studies focus exclusively on later life conditions and experiences to understand civic participation in old age. An exclusive reliance on this approach obscures the causes and consequences of civic participation trajectories over the life-course. Research needs to move on from identifying factors associated with civic participation among older people to examine how these factors unfold over time and influence individuals’ [e47] participation in (or withdrawal from) civic activities across the life-course. [e48]

#### 4. A need to better take into account older people's diversity when studying civic participation

> The small number of papers identified by this scoping review considered only one dimension of diversity, mainly having a disability or health condition, being a woman, or belonging to a racial or ethnic minority. In this respect, recent developments in intersectionality theory emphasize the importance of considering the nonadditive effects of multiple systems of inequality experienced by people with particular social locations. Age by itself represents a system of inequalities, as it has material consequences and influences life chances. Analysis of older people’s civic participation would benefit, therefore, from considering the interaction of age as a system of inequality with suchmother systems as gender, race, class, disability, or sexual orientation. [e48]


### Evaluation of a research awareness training programme to support research involvement of older people with dementia and their care partners

Här används begreppet 'Patient and public involvement (PPI)'. 

Det definieras här som...

> doing research with or by the public, rather than to, about, or for them. [1178]

Enligt artikeln råder en debatt om nödvändigheten för 'PPI contributors' att erhålla forskningsträning (med referens till följande två rapporter; en från INVOLVE och en från Healthtalk.org), där vissa anser att patienter och allmänheten är 'experts by experience' och därför inte behöver forskningsträning eftersom denna träning riskerar att deras perspektiv blir alltför likt forskarnas och längre bort från allmänheten då. Här hänvisas till följande studier:
- Gibson et al. (2015). Exploring the impact of
providing evidence-based medicine training to service users
- Dudley et al. (2015). A little more conversation please? Qualitative study of researchers’ and patients’ interview accounts of training for patient and public involvement in clinical trials.
- Ives et al. (2012). PPI, paradoxes and Plato: who’s sailing the ship?

Andra däremot menar att det är oförnuftigt att involvera människor utan att ge dem den basala kunskap som krävs för att de på ett meningsfullt sätt ska kunna delta. Här hänvisas till följande artikel:
- Turk A, Boylan A, Locock L. (2017) A researcher’s guide to patient and
public involvement a guide based on the experiences of health and
medical researchers, patients and members of the public.

Artikelförfattarna stödjer naturligtvis forskningsträning och hävdar följande:

> PPI is more likely to have a positive impact if PPI contributors receive appropriate training

..med hänvisning till följande studier:

- INVOLVE. (2012). Briefing notes for researchers
- Healthtalk.org (en rapport)
- INVOLVE. Developing training and support

Detta är alltså rapporter och inga vetenskapliga studier (!)

Om patienter och allmänheten som deltar inte erhåller träning så kan deras bidrag till forskningen bli "sub-optimal" och riskerar bidra till snarare än minska s.k. "research waste". Här hänvisas till följande studie:

- Minogue V, Cooke M, Donskoy AL, Vicary P, Wells B. Patient and
public involvement in reducing health and care research waste. Res
Involv Engagem. 2018;4(1):1–8.

#### Kort beskrivning av metod

7-10 personer med demens + caregiver ingår i en Research User Group. I studien har man 4 sådana grupper i fyra olika europeiska länder. Som ett komplemment till annan träning erhåller dessa forskningsträning av PPI-koordinatorer i form av interaktiva diskussioner (t.ex. interactive group work, role-play exercises, case studies and pictures). 

#### Slutsats från studien 

> RUG members reported that the training contents were applicable, useful and relevant to their involvement role in the research, fostered awareness of research and supported their involvement in research. This study demonstrates that the RAT package can be used to train older adults with dementia and their care partners. PPI contributors may be supported via facilitation by experts, individualized support, interactive discussions, informal discussion time and posting materials in advance of training. [1185]


### Awareness of and Attitudes Toward User Involvement in Research on Aging and Health: Protocol for a Quantitative Large-Scale Panel Study




###  Willingness to Participate in Health Research Among Community-Dwelling Middle-Aged and Older Adults: Does Race/Ethnicity Matter?

Här handlar det om att "to assess willingness to participate in different types of health research by race/ethnicity" för de som är 50+.

När det gäller deltagarna är det viktigt att säga att:

> Non-Hispanic White participants reported more past research participation than non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants (28.7% vs. 19.0% and 19.2%, respectively).

och den slutsats som här kan dras utifrån studiens resultat är att:

>compared with non-Hispanic White individuals, non-Hispanic Black individuals are less willing to participate in most studies, while Hispanic individuals are less willing to participate in studies that may be seen as invasive or demanding (required blood sample, genetic sample, participants to take medicine, or use of medical equipment).

Med andra ord visar studien att när det gäller viljan att (på olika sätt) delta i hälsovetenskaplig forskning så finns det åtminstone en studie som indikerar att etnicitet har betydelse för viljan att delta.

Eftersom vita i så större utsträckning hade deltagit i forskning skulle det också kunna vara en faktor som är relevant att ta med, eller?


I introduktionen står det också att:

> ...older adults have been found to be underrepresented in health research and the implications of this may affect treatment efficacy, health care utilization, and quality of life [39].

Här hänvisas visserligen till en clinical trial om cancer, men det kanske ändå kan vara användbart att använda referensen på något sätt för att måla upp diskrimineringen av äldre i mer generella termer.

### A scoping review: The utility of participatory research approaches in psychology

#### Syfte

Artikeln diskuterar och söker utvärdera hur PR approaches har använts inom olika områden för att se vilka lärdomar som kan dras. Så här ser studiens forskningsfrågor ut:

- (a) How are PR principles being used in six key areas of research
- (b) Across these areas, which studies can be considered exemplars?

#### Bra beskrivning av bakgrunden till PR

Här finns bakgrunden till PR beskriven på ett kortfattat och bra sätt:

> The roots of PR can be traced to a number of fields, including action research, adult education, critical sociology, and international development (Brown & Tandon, 1983; Kagan, 2012; Khanlou & Peter, 2005). PR originated in an atmosphere of increased concern for respect of individuals, beneficence, and justice for vulnerable populations, following several examples of extremely unethical or abusive practices in social science research, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study or the experimentation conducted on people in Nazi concentration camps (Blumenthal, // Hopkins, & Yancey, 2013; Khan et al., 2005; Manton et al., 2014). PR offers a way of collaborating with community members in the design and conduct of studies, as well as in the dissemination of research findings (Cargo & Mercer, 2008; Creswell, Hanson, Clark Plano, & Morales, 2007; Morris, 2002; Wint, 2011). Instead of being understood as research subjects, participants are involved as co‐researchers and recognized as having intimate experiential knowledge and robust knowledge systems. Their expertise positions them as important actors in developing and undertaking multiple aspects of projects (Morris, 2002). [1866-1867]

Detta är naturligtvis bara en tolkning av PR:s historia men jag tycker att utifrån den kunskap som jag har är övertygande.

#### Varierade definitioner och beskrivningar av vilka som utgör "partners"

En av de slutsatser som dras i denna scoping review handlar om den oklara terminologin och här fann jag stor igenkänning, inte minst i förhållande till vem som utgör en 'user', såsom diskussionen har gått inom UserAge. Så här skriver artikelförfattarna:

> Finally, our review highlights that while research “participants” in PR projects share the characteristic of being based in places other than postsecondary institutions, their characteristics are otherwise highly variable. For example, participants can be community organizations that provide services (e.g., Bowden et al., 2006; Checkoway & Richards‐Schuster, 2003), or service users themselves (e.g., Cotterell, 2008; Taggart et al., 2013). In research focused on youth/adolescent development, “participants” were sometimes youth (e.g., Flicker et al., 2008; Levac, 2013), but commonly parents, teachers, or youth‐serving organizations. Although it is difficult to offer universal guidance on establishing appropriate partnerships, a range of points merit attention. First, participatory researchers should remember that people with important experiential knowledge and expertise may not be affiliated with institutions and organizations. As well, organizational staff members with high levels of integrity may not fully understand the experiences of particular groups that they serve, including, for example, people living with HIV/AIDs, young people, or people who are transgender. Second, it is also the case that community organizations hold important knowledge and expertise and can thus be vital and reciprocal partners in research. A community's uptake of research may be more plausible through collaboration with an organization that is able to implement results. Third, participatory researchers may benefit from being aware of discussions about research insider/outsider positioning, but particularly the extent to which these boundaries are often fluid (Eppley, 2006), and how this fluidity can intersect with participatory research approaches (Spencer, 2015). These considerations, which may sit in tension with each other, lead to the conclusion that who counts as appropriate “participants” in PR requires careful consideration, and depends critically on the questions being asked and the purposes of the research. [1880]

Särskilt referenserna till hur 'fluid' dessa gränser är tycker jag verkar intressanta. Gränsen mellan vem som är en universitetsbaserad forskare och vem som är en co-researcher kanske inte alltid så tydlig. Det här kan ju också kopplas till representation. Vem representerar man när de olika identiteterna är så flytande?

Vidare skriver artikelförfattarna:

> Related to this point is the fact that “participants” across the studies we reviewed were described variously as co‐researchers, research team members, community researchers, peer researchers, and participants. While our emphasis in this study was not to review terminology, it is nevertheless important to point this out, if only to highlight the value of university‐based researchers being specific and descriptive about their language choices. In the future, it would be useful to try and understand the extent to which different terminology reflects varying levels of commitment to, or depth of, the PR process. [1881]

Detta är det också hög igenkänningsfaktor på för mig och det gäller att hitta en enhetlig och sammanhängande terminologi i mina individuella studier såväl som i kappan där jag kommer att hoppa mellan dem.

#### Vägar framåt 

När det kommer till vägar framåt föreslås en intressant sak med tanke på att PR är så krävande och vanligtvis har ett mer handlingsinriktat syfte:

> A third suggestion is for postsecondary institutions to permit alternative formats for student theses and dissertations. Allowing students to produce research results in formats useful to community organizations and citizens will inevitably have the effect of facilitating broader research outreach. [1881]


### Person-centred research practice: the user involvement in research of older adults with first-hand experience of reablement

Detta verkar vara ett accepterat manuskript, frågan är om det snart finns som publikation i en tidskrift. Har känskan av att försteförfattaren är en (norsk) doktorand med tanke på språket. Hur som helst finns det en del matnyttigt att hämta här eftersom området är snarlikt mitt.

Så här står det om syftet:

> In this article we describe and reflect on the processes and outcomes associated with advisory group-researcher collaboration. Our reflections emanate from our experience with the user-involvement of older adults with health-related conditions and first-hand experience in an advisory group.

Och forskningsfrågorna:

1) What are the important prerequisites associated with facilitating the user involvement of older adults with health-related conditions in research?
2) How can the involvement of older adults with first-hand experience improve research quality and relevance?
3) How can the involvement of older adults with health-related conditions and first-hand experience contribute to the improvement of person-centredness in research?

Det som betonas är att denna grupp har en health-related condition och förstahandserfarenhet av  som anses relevant för studien. Här argumenteras för att det inte finns så mycket forskning när det gäller involvering av personer med den sortens tillstånd och erfarenhet:

> apart from studies where older adults were included as research objects or informants, a relatively small number of studies on involvement in research of older adults with health-related conditions and first-hand experience currently exist. Also, findings on barriers to the involvement of such groups and the impact their involvement can have on research are limited and inconclusive. This indicates that more knowledge on the topic is needed.

När det kommer till definitionen av 'public involvement' står här:

> In one widely used definition of public involvement in research, research is viewed as being carried out ‘with’ or ‘by’ rather than ‘for’, ‘about’ or ‘to’ members of the public (INVOLVE, 2012). In that definition, public refers to the range of people and groups that may be involved in research: patients, potential patients, carers and people who use health and/or social care services as well as people from organisations who represent those who use such services. The use of the propositions ‘with’ and ‘by’ imply public involvement during all research steps: what to explore and how the research should be carried out, analysed and disseminated.

Inom UserAge använder vi ju oss också av en sådan definition, men har den sin upprinnelse i INVOLVE alltså? Sannolikt inte men frågan är vilken referens som är lämplig för mig att använda. Vidare skriver artikelförfattaren:

> Research initiatives in which older adults are involved as co-researchers often take the form of invitations from researchers (Fudge, Wolfe and McKevitt, 2007). Participants found in this manner seldom have personal or first-hand experience of the research topic (Ward and Gahagan, 2012). Instead, the focus in such research is placed on age as an indicator of representativeness. In a review on the impact of involving older adults in research that encompassed 30 studies, most studies did not give further participant details other than that the participants were aged 50+ (Fudge et al., 2007). In another review that encompassed nine studies, older adults as co-researchers were seen in some of the studies to have experience from the area being studied or had old-age-related conditions, but most studies did not give further participant details (Baldwin, Napier, Neville and Wright-St Clair, 2018).

Detta är ju intressant, att dessa studier tillkommer på initiativ av forskare, samt att co-researcher ofta inte har personlig eller förstahandskunskap om det ämne det forskas om.

Sedan är det ju tragiska att människor i den här sortens studier endast blir en siffra och några andra aspekter än ålder inte direkt räknas med.

#### Vad får co-researchers ut av att vara med?

> Baldwin et al. found that older co-researchers experienced both benefits and challenges when participating in research: psychological and social benefits, new learning, activism and career opportunities but also demanding workloads, difficult relationships and dissatisfaction with the level of involvement.

#### Vad får academic researchers ut av att vara med?

> Academic researchers who included older co-researchers in their research experienced new learning and shared workloads, but also demanding workloads an difficult relationships (Baldwin et al., 2018).

#### Hur påverkar co-researcher involvement forskningsprocessen och utkomsten av forskningen?

> In their review, Fudge et al. found anecdotal evidence that the involvement of older adults as co-researchers resulted in changes on the individual level but found little evaluation of how such involvement changed research processes or outcomes (Fudge et al., 2007).

#### Vad behöver man som forskare tänka på när man involverar äldre i forskning på detta sätt? Krävs någon form av anpassningar?

> In a review of the methods used to involve older adults in health research, nine studies that fit the definition of PPI in research as delineated by INVOLVE were included. The researchers saw that while the involvement in research of older adults with old-age-related conditions is feasible, there could be specific challenges (Schilling and Gerhardus, 2017). In that review, strategies that can enhance the effective involvement of older adults with old-age-related conditions in research were identified, such as thoughtful choice of location, use of visualisation and accessible communication, building good relationships and flexible approaches. Conversely, in another review, Fudge et al. (2007) found no specific barriers to the involvement of older adults in research. The different findings may be due to the fact that Schilling and Gerhardus explicitly sought out studies that included older adults with old-age-related conditions related to the research topic.

#### Slutsats?

Slutsatsen i artikeln var dessvärre en besvikelse. Så här står det:

> We found that engaging older adults with first-hand experience of reablement in an advisory group on a consultant level in the initial phase of a research project was highly beneficial and therefore can be advocated. The members in our advisory group had first-hand experience of reablement, but our findings and experiences may be relevant to other similar person-centred research projects where older adults with health-related conditions are involved as co-researchers.



### Optimizing the Meaningful Engagement of Older Adults With Multimorbidity and Their Caregivers as Research Partners: A Qualitative Study

#### Syftet med studien

> The objective of this study was to examine how researchers can best engage and support older adults with multimorbidity and informal friend or family caregivers of older adults with multimorbidity as research partners in health care research teams.

#### Tidigare forskning som citeras

> A compelling base of expert opinions and experiences suggest that engagement of older adults and caregivers in health care research can improve the relevance, acceptability, and usability of research findings (Domecq et al., 2014; Duffett, 2016; Vat et al., 2017).

Domecq klingar bekant från en annan artikel; den referensen får jag kolla upp. Här pratas det alltså om 'health care research' och inte 'health research'. Vidare står det att 'the engagement of older adults and caregivers', med andra ord såväl patienter som människor i vårdprofessioner om jag tolkar saken rätt. 

Vad detta engagemang har möjlighet att förbättra är 'relevansen' (att adekvata, samhällsrelevanta forskningsfrågor ställs kopplade till reella problem - det är så jag tolkar det); 'acceptability' (vems acceptability, det är frågan.); 'usability' (det vill säga att interventionerna (som jag misstänker att det handlar om) tas i bruk och anses användbara även efter avslutad forskningsstudie.

Med andra ord är det här - misstänker jag - fokus på att överbrygga teori och praktk klyftan kopplat till (evidensbaserade) interventioner. Det är vad jag anar. 

#### Barriärer för att delta aktivt i forskning

> Additional barriers may include the fact that many experience health challenges or may find it difficult to participate given their caregiving responsibilities (Holroyd-Leduc et al., 2016; Marlett & Emes, 2010).

I de refererade artiklarna verkar det alltså finnas visst stöd för hypotesen att sviktande hälsa såväl som 'caregiving responsibilities' kan ha en negativ inverkan på möjligheten att delta aktivt i forskning.

#### Ytterligare forskning kring HUR äldre ska involveras i forskning krävs

> The published literature presents strategies that lack detail and provide limited direction to best engage older adults in health care research, while unpublished documents present actionable strategies but lack credibility, dependability, and confirmability.

#### Studiens slutsats

> The implications of these findings are that to optimize meaningful patient engagement among this population, considerations must be made to support the needs and perspectives of research partners during their recruitment, to plan for meaningful engagement, and to establish collaborative relationships. In addition, the persona-scenario method is a promising design that encourages the active engagement of patients and caregivers as research partners in the co-design, implementation, evaluation of health care research, and the dissemination of research findings.

### Dissemination and stakeholder engagement practices among dissemination & implementation scientists: Results from an online survey

#### Nytt begrepp: 'dissemination & implementation scientists'

Här nämns de för mig nya begreppet/begreppen 'dissemination & implementation scientists'. Någon tydlig definition av vad som utmärker dessa forskare ges tyvärr inte.

#### Kort om studiens syfte
Det verkar som att denna artikel handlar om en studie i form av en enkätstudie som gått ut till forskare med frågor om dissemination och implementation. Så här motiverar de sin studie genom att nämna en tydlig kunskapslucka:

> What is less known is the extent to which there have been increases in the use of evidence based and best practices among dissemination and implementation (D&I) researchers, and if there are differences in dissemination practices across different types of D&I researchers.

Vidare skriver de:

> There has been a strong encouragement to meaningfully engage patients and community stakeholders in research from PCORI, NIH, and other organizations [10]. Two relatively recent developments of interest have been use of social media and stakeholder engagement practices [11, 12]. While each of these has existed for decades, most health care and public health researchers have not been early adopters of these approaches, and we were interested in what specific engagement strategies D&I researchers use and the extent to which they used them

Som jag tolkar det handlar det inte så mycket om att engagera engagera patienter och 'community stakeholders' i själva forskningen som sådan utan mer i spridandet av den kunskap som forskare emellan redan har fått fram, men jag kan ha fel.

#### Vilka var enkätens respondenter?

> Potential survey respondents were identified by being listed as a corresponding author on an original research article published in the journal Implementation Science between 1/1/2014 and 12/31/2017, having completed recent training related to D&I science, or had been funded to conduct D&I research.

Ja, så kan man ju också snäva av men det är väl oundvikligen så at lika barn leka bäst.

#### Definition av 'dissemination'

> Dissemination, defined as “an active approach of spreading evidence-based interventions to the target audience via predetermined channels using planned strategies” [1, 2], is the critical process linking research findings to practitioners who can implement them, leading to benefits among the people or communities of interest. [p. 2/12]

#### Frequently recommended dissemination practices

> Frequently recommended dissemination practices to reach non-research audiences include “Designing for Dissemination” [1, 3, 4], use of multiple channels, development of guides to program implementation, and engagement of multiple types of stakeholders in the development and evaluation of interventions and dissemination plans.

Detta är alltså en artikel skriven utifrån synsättet att kunskap ska tas fram av forskare och sen implementeras ute i praktiken av delvis andra än forskare. Detta synsätt skiljer sig något, skulle jag säga från tänket inom design, där man normalt utformar något mer lokalt på plats och där glappet mellan teoretisk och praktisk kunskap är mindre. 


#### Några av studiens slutsatser

> With the increasing focus on disseminating research to practice [20] and a rapidly changing landscape of dissemination strategies, it is helpful to periodically assess what strategies D&I scientists are using to communicate evidence to practitioners and policy makers. 

Det handlar alltså om att "communicate evidence to practitioners and policy makers", inte om att engagera dem på något mer djuplodande sätt än så. 

> This report updated and expanded the survey conducted in 2012 by Brownson and colleagues, but also sampled a broader range of D&I researchers (clinicians and Canadian D&I (KT) scientists) in addition to the public health researchers included in the 2012 sample, and provided greater depth on the evolving area of stakeholder engagement. 

> D&I scientists reported engaging in varied dissemination activities, some but not all of which have increased, since the 2012 survey of public health researchers.

> Comparisons were made on results from items that were identical or very similar to those reported in Brownson et al.’s earlier survey of public health researchers. Specifically, respondents in both samples reported using a variety of strategies to disseminate their work, but most frequently used traditional methods of publications in scientific journals and presentations at scientific meetings. This method is likely to influence the work of fellow researchers, who consistently report learning about emerging science in these venues [21, 22], but often neglects the seminars, professional association meetings, and electronic newsletters that local and state-level practitioners are more apt to use in their efforts to stay up-to-date [23]. The ongoing predominance of these modes of dissemination today, despite believing other methods of dissemination (including face-to-face meetings, writing policy briefs, and presenting seminars or workshops) to be potentially more effective in reaching and engaging practitioners, is likely due to the reward system of academic institutions. 

> The general sentiment that dissemination of findings to non-research partners is a core responsibility of those engaged in academic pursuits appears to be shared between the two samples, despite several differences in their respective characteristics.

### A formative qualitative evaluation to inform implementation of a research participation enhancement and advocacy training program for diverse seniors: the DREAMS program


#### Studiens syfte
Här handlar det om...

> a formative qualitative evaluation conducted to identify potential barriers and facilitators prior to implementation of a two-part educational intervention designed to increase older adults’ participation in clinical research.

Alltså att utvärdera en intervention (i form av en slags utbildning) för att öka äldre personers deltagande i klinisk forskning. Det är ju inte riktigt mitt område men det kan vara intressant ändå.

#### Slutsatser

##### Fear and mistrust of researchers and research
> Findings from thematic analysis showed that common barriers to research participation included older adults’ fear and mistrust of researchers and the medical community as well as misperceptions and negative attitudes about clinical research. A commonly held belief was that most clinical research is conducted by “greedy” pharmaceutical companies who are more interested in profits than finding cures for disease.

Alltså visar studien att ett vanligt hinder för att delta i klinisk forskning är äldre personers rädsla och misstro mot forskare och 'the medical community' liksom felaktiga föreställnngar och negativa attityder gentemot klinisk forskning som anses gå ut på mer att tjäna pengar åt medicinföretag än hitta botemodel mot sjukdomar.

Detta är ju intressant eftersom denna studie kan jag referera till och använda som motivation till att vi ställer frågor i enkäten om förtroende för forskare och forskningen.

Vidare skriver artikelförfattarna:

> Similar to previous research investigating barriers to research participation among racial and ethnic minority populations (Scharff et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2010), we found that fear and attitudes of mistrust related to the Tuskegee Syphilis Study were strong recurring themes across SES groups, particularly among African American participants.

Denna studie läste jag om i en tidigare artikel som utgörande en bakgrund till varför Participatory research lanserades.

> In line with previous research (Haley et al., 2017; Herrera et al., 2010), current findings also point to a need to develop more effective ways to communicate information regarding informed consent and study procedures, especially when enrolling participants with low levels of education. As noted by our SPs, this education needs to include better ways of helping participants understand the purpose of HIPAA language used in consent forms.

##### Ageism

> Another barrier we identified to recruiting older adults that has not received as much attention in the literature was perceived ageist attitudes of researchers and health professionals. Many older adults also complained about a general lack of respect, which included the belief that the real purpose of research studies and study findings is often withheld from study participants. Some indicated that being treated with respect as research partners was more important than receiving other types of incentives (i.e., money or food).

##### Perceiving  meaningful benefit - a facilitator to research participation

> Our findings and other recent findings (George et al., 2014; Hughes et al., 2017) show that an important facilitator to research participation is perceiving some meaningful benefit either personally or for the good of others.


##### Other barriers

> Other barriers to recruiting older adults that we identified and have been well documented in the literature (Manson, Tamim, & Baker, 2017; McHenry et al., 2012) included limited mobility, transportation issues, communication barriers, and competing interests.



#### Tidigare forskning


##### Older adults from low-income and racial and ethnic minorities underrepresented in research
> Older adults from low-income and racial and ethnic minority populations are particularly at risk of adverse health outcomes related to chronic illness and multimorbidity. These individuals have historically been underrepresented in research (Kaiser, Thomas, & Bowers, 2017; Purnell et al., 2016). [960]


##### Engagement of older adults from low-income and racial and ethnic minorities imperative to address growing diversity and health disparities
> Engagement of low-income and racial and ethnic minority older adults in research is imperative to address the growing diversity among and health disparities between older populations in the United States. [960]

##### Known barriers to research participation 
> Barriers to their research participation include distrust of the medical and research community, and fears related to a history of well-documented unethical research practices (Hughes, Varma, Pettigrew, & Albert, 2017; Williams et al., 2010), limited access and opportunities to participate, including stringent trial inclusion and exclusion criteria (Hamaker, Stauder, & van Munster, 2014; Herrera et al., 2010; Hughes et al., 2017), language and communication barriers (Haley et al., 2017; Larson, Cohn, Meyer, & Boden-Albala, 2009), ageism and physical health impairments (Hamaker et al., 2014; Herrera et al., 2010; Hughes et al., 2017), and consent challenges related to cognitive impairment or low health literacy (Haley et al., 2017; Herrera et al., 2010). Identifying barriers and facilitators to older adults’ research participation is vital to increasing their recruitment and retention in clinical studies as well as improving the quality of health care this group receives.

##### Importance of Patient and community input

> Patient and community input to research methods and interpretation are increasingly recognized as vital to developing patient-centered care, and have proven successful in the past to promote stakeholder buy-in and tailor studies involving diverse aging populations and multiple stakeholders to be culturally responsive (Idler, Grant, Quest, Binney, & Perkins, 2015; Manson et al., 2017; Mirk et al., 2016; Miyawaki, Belza, Kohn, & Petrescu-Prahova, 2018; Primetica, Menne, Bollin, Teri, & Molea, 2015). 


### Black-white differences in willingness to participate and perceptions about health research: results from the Population-Based Health Street Study

Här är egentligen främst resultatet från studien och de slutsatser som därmed kan dras intressanta. Artikelförfattarna skriver så här i andra halvan av sitt abstract:

> AAs (African-Americans) were statistically significantly less likely to have previously participated in a research study, be willing to volunteer for any type of health research study, or to trust research or researchers compared to Whites. 

> AAs also desired significantly higher compensation amounts to participate compared with Whites adults. 

> In logistic regression analysis, education, age, gender, visits to healthcare practitioners and facilities were statistically significant predictors for AAs participation in health research. 

> Keeping in view the findings of our study, clinical and public health researchers and practitioners should use special recruitment and retention strategies to increase the participation of AAs in health research studies.

Här handlar det visserligen inte om specifikt aktivt deltagande i forskning men resultatet från studien kan ändå användas som grund för varför vi ställer vissa frågor i enkäten såväl som i den specifika studien i artikel två. 

Det som denna studie säger är att etnicitet har betydelse, liksom vilken kompensation som ges samt utbildning, ålder, kön och hur ofta man frekventerar hälso- och sjukvården.

### Preparing researchers for patient and public involvement in scientific research: development of a hands-on learning approach through action research

#### Rationale och syfte

>...it is not only patients who need education, but researchers also require practical tools, recommendations and structured training to show the benefits of PPI and provide guidance on ways to customize PPI methods for specific research projects [7,15]
[p. 753]

> It is clear that researchers need evidence to justify their PPI efforts and guidance on ways to apply the above­mentioned concepts in daily practice. [7] The literature also suggests that sustainability should be ensured by creating a “soft” infrastructure, including a culture of participation and a solid set of policies, rules and procedures. [3,5] This means that educating researchers should be combined with the establishment of a community of practice that provides active and long­term support and facilitation of senior and junior researchers. [24] It may even require a new approach to education and coaching to really enhance the implementation of meaningful PPI and to reduce the risks of tokenism. What is needed is a programme or coaching approach where researchers can simultaneously learn about PPI, debate personal values and beliefs, share practices and experiences on a regular basis and develop a shared identity around PPI. They also need an approach that integrates strategies at the level of individual researchers with those of the research institute. This is why in 2013, senior and junior researchers of the Research Centre on Autonomy and Participation of People with a Long­term Condition at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences The Netherlands developed a systematic approach to the implementation of PPI in research projects. [25]
[p. 753]

> The objective of this article was to describe and reflect on the development of a hands­on learning approach through a process of shared learning, debate and the exchange of experiences, supported by the provision of relevant evidence.
[p. 753]

Denna studie visar ju att det har gjorts seriösa försök att skapa en forskningsmiljö där forskare fostras i att utföra PPI-forskning. Vilka erfarenheter kan de då dela med sig av och vilka slutsatser drar de utifrån sitt arbete med denna 'learning approach'?

Här finns en hel del matnyttigt att hämta kring upplägget och innehållet i denna utbildning. Det är forstås holländare som ligger bakom denna studie. Känns att de ligger så långt före där inom detta område. Det verkar också som att de har hämtat lite av verktygen från designområdet i utbildningen, åtminstone har den en hel del interaktiva inslag som går ut på att extrahera sina värderingar och sin kunskap på ett sätt som är kreativt.

Här finns t.ex. en 'Participation matrix' som... "gives an overview of patient and public involvement (PPI) within research projects based on the “participation game.” For example in data collection, PPI on advising means the advice of patient partners in research and consulting means PPI as participants in an interview".

Inom denna matrix delas graden av PPI in i fyra stadier: consulting; advising, partnership och control. I matrisen delas forakningsprocessen också in i steg nämligen: preparatory work; recruitment; design of PPI; data collection; analysis; identification of most important research findings; dissemination. Intressant nog används 'dissemination' som begrepp även här. För att återknyta lite till studien jag nyss läste så kan dissemination definieras så här:

> Dissemination, defined as “an active approach of spreading evidence-based interventions to the target audience via predetermined channels using planned strategies” [1, 2], is the critical process linking research findings to practitioners who can implement them, leading to benefits among the people or communities of interest. 
[@knoepke2019, p. 2/12]

Frågan är om det är denna slags dissemination som åsyftas i detta fall eller om det är något annat.

#### Structural challenges identified by the junior researcher participants
Ett annat intressant resultat i studien är de sju 'structural challenges identified by the junior researcher participants' som listas i tabell 3 [p. 759]: 

1. Unclear which organizations to contact for recruiting patient
representatives: Does the research centre have preferred organiza-
tions to consult or to work with? Does the institute keep records of
existing working relations or contact persons for patient
organizations? 
2. Patient and public involvement (PPI) insufficiently specified in
research proposals: How much PPI can be done without missing
important deadlines?
3. Uncertainty about the priority of PPI in the views of the research
centre. How much time am I allowed to spend on PPI? Will I be
supported by my superiors when input of patient representatives
leads to changes in the design, conduct or outcomes of my study?
4. Lack of guidance on how to budget for meaningful PPI
5. Absence of a policy for remunerating patient representatives in
research projects. For example: Is it possible to pay a symposium fee
for a patient representative? Is there a budget for child care for a
patient representative? Is it allowed to pay patient representatives
for their involvement? And if so, what is a reasonable compensation?
6. Lack of guidance on recognizing the contributions of patient
representatives, not only individually, but also at the level of the
research centre.
7. Do regulations exist for acknowledgement or co-­authorship of
documents, brochures and scientific manuscripts?




#### Slutsats

> We conclude that a stepwise approach, based on action research, coaching and dialogue between peers, empowers senior and junior researchers to acquire concepts and tools to engage patients in a meaningful way. We recommended distinguishing between the roles and responsibilities of senior and of junior researchers.
[p. 762]

Anledningen till att de ser uppdelningen mellan juniora och seniora forskare som fruktbar bottnar i detta:

> We also learned the importance of differentiating between the tasks and responsibilities of senior and junior researchers....supporting PPI is not the same as facilitating. Providing this coaching programme is an example of facilitating PPI, meaning that the institute’s leadership acknowledged the need for PPI coaching for researchers, and assumed responsibility for providing the resources to make this happen. 
[p. 761]



### Transdisciplinary research for impact: protocol for a realist evaluation of the relationship between transdisciplinary research collaboration and knowledge translation

OBS! Detta är endast ett studieprotokoll, ej en fullständig vetenskaplig artikel.

#### Bakgrund

> ...little empirical evidence exists on whether (and how) transdisciplinary collaboration influences research outcomes, including those typically associated with translation, such as research productivity (eg, number of publications). [ref.1]

> Given the growing emphasis on transdisciplinary paradigms, research is needed to develop stronger theoretical explanations of if, how, why, for whom and under what circumstances transdisciplinary collaboration influences knowledge translation.

Det är alltså det som studien avser göra.


#### Syfte

Syftet med studien är...

>The aims of this study are to understand: (i) various perspectives of knowledge translation within a transdisciplinary research team and (ii) if, how, for whom and under what circumstances a transdisciplinary research approach and associated knowledge sharing activities can contribute to a shared understanding of knowledge translation.

#### RQs

Our research questions are as follows:
1. Does transdisciplinary collaboration impact knowl-
edge translation and if so, by which mechanisms is
this achieved?
2. What contextual factors determine whether the
identified mechanisms produce their intended out-
comes?
3. In what circumstances (ie, combination(s) of context
factors and mechanisms) are transdisciplinary teams
most likely to be effective in terms of impacting knowl-
edge translation?

#### Hur definieras 'Knowledge translation'(KT)?

> ...knowledge translation (ie, the interactive and iterative process of knowledge creation, sharing and use for better health outcomes, and involving multiple system stakeholders) [ref. 6]

Med KT åsyftas här alltså inte bara själva överförandet utan även genererandet av kunskap. Det var för mig något nytt att definitionen var så vid.

#### Olikheter i konceptualiseringen av KT kan utgöra barriärer för hur den lyckas

> How diverse team members understand and enact the concept and process of knowledge translation (ie, the interactive and iterative process of knowledge creation, sharing and use for better health outcomes, and involving multiple system stakeholders) [ref. 6] can produce barriers to knowledge creation and knowledge sharing activities conducted within the team. Such barriers may have subsequent downstream effects on the uptake and impact of the knowledge produced.

Bra att de tar upp det. 


#### Barriers to intraorganisational knowledge translation

> Barriers to intraorganisational knowledge translation have been studied outside of the health context. For example, Carlile, [ref. 7] in an ethnographic study of product development, identified three types of boundaries, described as *syntactic* (eg, language and terminology), *semantic* (eg, interpretation of knowledge) and *pragmatic* (eg, the nature of knowledge; organisational politics and culture; roles and responsibilities). Similar boundaries— each with different levels of complexity—are likely to exist in collaborative academic environments. [ref. 5] Understanding more about such boundaries and resultant barriers to internal knowledge translation activities can inform planning and facilitate collaboration across disciplines.

För att sammanfatta så verkar denna studie lovande, men detta är bara protokollet så än så länge finns inget resultat.




### Involving older people in research: methodological issues

Artikeln är gammal, från 2005, så frågan är hur användbar den egentligen är.

#### PPI som begrepp tycks ha sin upprinnelse i en strategi från NHS

> User involvement and increasing choice for patients have emerged as important themes of UK health policy. The NHS Plan (Department of Health 2000) and the accompanying policy (Department of Health 1999) set out plans to establish a new system of patient and public involvement for England to replace community health councils (CHCs). These policy developments represent a raft of changes which promote systems of improving the quality of patient information, advocacy and complaints systems, and involvement in planning and evaluation at all levels of commissioning and operation.

I citatet ovan framkommer en del intressanta saker som jag inte hade koll på. Det var ju i viss mån känt för mig att s.k. 'user involvement' förordades utifrån (UK) health policy, men inte att som det antyds här PPI som begrepp har sin upprinnelse i en ny policy från NHS (syftandes till att lansera 'a new systems of patient and public involvement') och att det ersatt något som kallas 'community health councils (CHSs)'

#### Clarifying terminologi 

Vidare skriver artikelförfattarna:

> It is not surprising that the systemic and radical change intended by these policies results in tensions in their implementation. This is reflected in the uncertainty over terminology, and the need to negotiate new professional and service-user relationships and boundaries.

Apropå terminologin skriver de:

> The assumptions made in relation to involvement are often diffuse, overlapping and lack conceptual clarity. 

##### Om den oklara innebörden av 'user involvement'

> For example, the term ‘user involvement’ is used to describe a range of activities which seek to include service users in health or social care for different purposes and in different ways. Boote et al . (2002) identified the conceptual confusion underlying the meaning of involvement in health research, which is illustrated by the problematic use of terms such as ‘lay’, ‘service user’ or ‘consumer’, and the inherent difficulties of defining groups and their relationships to or with healthcare, which may reflect or ‘be influenced by the agenda of the person or organisation using the term’ (Boote et al . 2002,
p. 215).

Detta är en bra referens att knyta an till i min avhandling.

##### 'Lay', 'consumer or 'user?'

> The scoping exercise conducted on behalf of Consumers in National Health Service (NHS) Research (an advisory group funded by the Department of Health, now known as INVOLVE) adopted the term ‘lay’ because it was seen to encompass involvement through life experience, and be inclusive of service users, carers, patients, clients and citizens (Baxter et al . 2001). While patient and public involvement is the overarching terminology used in current UK policy documents, the terms ‘user’ and ‘consumer’ tend to be used interchangeably. ‘Consumer’ is marginally the preferred term because it encompasses wider notions of both the potential and actual service recipient, and because, for some, ‘user’ invokes associations with substance misuse (Boote et al . 2002). The term ‘consumer’ was adopted for the panel in the present study on falls on the advice of the consumer member of the research team, although this was not the preference of all the participants.

#### The (presumed) reason for increasing involvement in research

> Increasing involvement in research reflects the policy drive for greater accountability for quality and patient-centred outcomes, and is based on the assumption that it will lead to services which are of better quality and more relevant to the priorities and needs of patients (Coote 1993, Poulton 1999, Truman & Raine 2002, Faulkner & Thomas 2002).

Mycket bra källa att använda (om än något gammal)!


#### The ideology of involvement in research shifts the balance of power away from the professional

> However, giving greater prominence to service users serves to contest the nature and control of professional knowledge, decision-making and knowledge production (Popay & Williams 1996). Therefore, the ideology of involvement in research, if taken to its logical conclusion, necessitates reframing the social relations of research sponsorship and production, and shifting the balance of power away from the professional.

Mycket bra iakttagelse och reflektion som ofta lyser med sin frånvaro. Dock undrar jag vad som 'professional' i detta fall syftar på. Är det forskaren eller människor i hälso- och sjukvårdsprofessionen? Hur som helst så medför ett sådant skifte att 'lay persons' eller 'users', 'consumers' eller vad man väljer att benämna dem, tilldelas mer makt och inflytande, en makt som då de professionella oavsett om de är yrkesverksamma inom hälso- och sjukvården eller om det är frågan om forskare, måste göra avkall på.

Samtidigt framträder här en viss motsägelse eller vad man ska säga för här ligger fokus så starkt på 'users' och 'consumers' alltså vanligt folk i rollen som medborgare, medan vi i UserAge involverar människor inte bara i rollen som medborgare och konsumenter utan t.ex. i rollen som att de utifrån sin profession besitter en viss kunskp. De är således inte alltid där i rollen som att de har erfarenhet av att ha en viss erfarenhet av att leva som en äldre person i Sverige  (utifrån att de är äldre medborgare) eller att de utgör en representant för (äldre) medborgare, utan vi tar in dem för att de delvis besitter en annan kompetens och har en annan erfarenhet som inte enbart är kopplat till deras roll som medborgare eller vårdkonsument i en hälso- och sjukvårdsapparat. Det är viktigt att komma ihåg. Det är också därför 'users' blir ett sånt svårt begrepp för främst Christine och mig att ta till eftersom de grupper vi vill få in i det begreppet vanligtvis inte hör dit.

#### Current research governance at odds with authentic participation

> Beresford (2003a) pointed out that research governance, which is essentially ‘managerialist/consumerist’ and a top-down policy, can be at odds with authentic participation in the research process, which may be both ambiguous and bottom-up. 

> Beresford (2003a) went on to argue that user-controlled research should focus on who originates and makes decisions about research and its evaluation, thus defining it in terms of the degree of control that consumers and research participants have in the process. If health services researchers are to move beyond the rhetoric of user involvement, it is important to think about the nature of the relationship at a number of levels including sponsor, commissioner, informed participant and co-researcher.

Verkligt deltagarinflytande och brukarkontrollerad forskning är i grunden en fråga om vem som "originates and makes decisions about research and its evaluation" - alltså är det en fråga om "the degree of control that consumers and research participants have in the process". 

Det tycker jag att Beresford har helt rätt i. Detta blir därför oundvikligen en väldigt politisk fråga. Vem ska tilldelas makten över (kunskaps)produktionsmedlen som i sin tur i viss mån  blir vägledande för hur hälso- och sjukvårdsrelaterade tjänster och produkter utformas? Är det som nu forskare, eller ska "folket" i större utsträckning tilldelas den makten? Vad får det för konsekvenser? Är inte risken att forskningen då blir mer populistisk och direkt problemlösande till sin natur och att vetenskapligheten i form av bidrag till det vetenskapliga samtalet minskar? Är det en nackdel?

#### Both professionals and consumers will need training to adapt to a changed context of relationships

> If health services researchers are to move beyond the rhetoric of user involvement, it is important to think about the nature of the relationship at a number of levels including sponsor, commissioner, informed participant and co-researcher. In addition, the development and training needs of both professionals and consumers will need to be addressed since they will be working within a changed context of relationships, and one which inevitably challenges established research traditions.

Exakt. Det krävs utbildning av såväl "brukare" som forskare för att bägge ska kunna finna sig tillrätta i den nya kontexten som uppstått i vilken forskare också får finna sig i att göra avkall på en viss del av den makt de har haft traditionellt sett.

#### The growth of the role of consumers in a variety of research activities

Vidare beskriver Ross att detta arbete har tagit fart (observera att året då detta skrivs är 2005) och ger exempel på i vilka områden representanter för brukare eller konsumenter har gjort sitt inträde:

> This area of work is developing rapidly and is reflected in the growth of the role of consumers in a variety of research activities which encompass: priority setting for national research and development (R&D) programmes (Thornicroft et al . 2002, Ross et al . 2004); commissioning research (INVOLVE 2003a); promoting involvement in trials and ensuring that the Medical Research Council (MRC) is responsive to consumer interests (the MRC’s Consumer Liaison Group); and helping people to make informed, evidence-based decisions (the Cochrane Collaboration Consumer Network: www.cochrane.org/consumers/homepage.htm ).

Det blir tydligt att vad detta handlar om är just ett sanktionerat motstånd i form av att det är politiker själva som - också utifrån den allmänna opinionen såklart och brukarorganisationernas växande makt - har tilldelat brukar/konsumentrepresentanter en plats vid bordet i sammanhang där viktiga beslut rörande forskning och utveckling (dessa områden tenderar här att smälta ihop något) fattas. Så här skriver Ross uttryckligen:

> ...the drive for consumer involvement came from policy imperatives and the research commissioning priorities, and undoubtedly provided a receptive context for altering social relations to empower consumers... [p. 272]

Det är förståeligt att de tilldelas den makten för det ligger också i politikers - och andra beslutsfattare kopplade till frågor som rör forsking och utveckling - intresse att undvika situationer där de anklagas för att inte ha hörsammat folkets (och då särskilt utsatta gruppers) vilja. Participatory research växte ju i viss mån fram i skenet av en del skandaler där minoriteter farit väldigt illa i forskning.

#### Aim with this paper

> This paper seeks to address the gap in the literature on the approaches and methods which can inform the development of appropriate models of involvement.

Det Ross försöker göra är alltså att rikta in sig på HUR:et, det vill säga hur denna involvering ska gå till på bästa sätt (och skissa på en form av modell för detta). Hon gör det genom att utgå från en fallstudie (i dubbel bemärkelse) - om 'consumer involvement' i forskning om fall.

> The aim of this paper is not to report on the study design or the substantive findings, but to share and reflect upon our experience of involvement of older people in the research, and to discuss the implications for methodological development.

#### PAR is informed by participative inquiry theory

> Participatory action research is informed by participative inquiry theory (Reason 1998), which acknowledges the need for an ‘alternative system of knowledge production based on the people’s role in setting agendas and participating in the data gathering and analysis and controlling the use of the outcomes’ (p. 271).

Har aldrig hört talas om 'participatory inquiry theory' men det låter intressant.


#### Vilken roll hade 'consumer panel' i fallstudien?

> The role of the panel was to ensure that the way that the project was carried out, interpreted and disseminated was relevant to older people using health and social services. This is similar to the role of an advisory group described by Rhodes et al . (2002), which supported and contributed to the evaluation of diabetes services in Bradford.

Det är tydligt att konsumentrepresentanternas roll i detta handlade just om hur de utifrån sin roll som hälso- och sjukvårdskonsumenter upplevde tillvaron och vilka möjligheter och begränsningar den erbjöd.


#### Change theory?

> Presenting the process diagrammatically has limitations in that it implies linearity, whereas in reality the process was dynamic and multifaceted as is seen in change theory (Pettigrew et al. 1992). [p. 272]

*Change theory* har jag aldrig hört talas om, det verkar intressant.


#### Slutsatser

Nedanstående citat tycker jag beskriver bra hur involveringen av brukare kan påverka forskningen och forskarna och jag tror att det som beskrivs där är rätt så allmängiltigt för brukarinvolvering i forskning generellt:

> There were many examples in panel meetings of consumers taking the opportunity of a platform to move the discussion beyond the narrow confines of the research project and the topic of falls to make statements about the local environment or other issues which affected the health and well-being of older people locally, such as public transport. It was becoming apparent that the panel’s role in influencing change was not only shifting the focus of accountability for the outcomes of the research, but also changing the nature of the relationship between the researcher and consumer, which suggests that the process may be unpredictable and non-linear.

När det gäller de mer explicita slutsatserna hittade jag inget speciell, Ross gör en skiss på en lite svårtydd modell och kommentarar modellen lite vagt:

> the emerging model of involvement that is illustrated in Figure 2 suggests links between the context, process and resulting impact and benefits which accrued.

Och den mer generella slutsatsen att...
> There is no single blueprint for involvement as it entails working with a diversity of perspectives.

Det är egentligen inte dessa slutsatser som är det viktiga och centrala i artikeln utan den historielektion hon erbjuder och sättet hon ramar in och beskriver 'consumer involvement' och vilka frågor det väcker. Det är det jag främst tar med mig


### Service user involvement in nursing, midwifery and health visiting research: A review of evidence and practice

Detta är en något senare artikel där Fiona Ross ingår som författare jämfört med den artikel hon skrivit själv med titeln 'Involving older people in research: methodological issues'.

Från att ha benämnt fenomenet 'consumer involvement' pratas det i denna artikel om 'service users' och 'service user involvement'. Oklart varför denna beteckning vunnit mark men det är nog så att t.ex. Beresford (som ju är sisteförfattare på denna artikel) har haft ett inflytande skulle jag tro.

#### Bakgrund och syfte

> UK policy recommends that service users (patients, carers and the public) should be involved in all publicly funded health and social care research. However, little is known about which approaches work best in different research contexts and why. The purpose of this paper is to explain some of the theoretical limitations to current understandings of service user involvement and to provide some suggestions for theory and methods development. This paper draws upon ﬁndings from a review of the research ‘evidence’ and current practice on service user involvement in the design and undertaking of nursing, midwifery and health visiting research.

> The aim of the study was to inform the NHS Service Delivery and Organisation (SDO) Research and Development Programme about the theory and evidence on service user involvement in the design and undertaking of nursing, midwifery and health visiting research. [300]


#### Definition of 'service user'

> We chose to use the Department of Health deﬁnition of a ‘service user’: any person who has, is, or may access NHS or independent sector health services in the UK (Department of Health (DH), 1999). [300]

Här blir det tydligt hur vår breda definition av 'brukare' eller 'kunskapsanvändare' ter sig olämplig tycker jag. 'Service user' har en tydlig koppling till hälso- och sjukvårdskonsumption. Punkt slut.

#### Svårt att utvärdera effekten av 'service user involvement'

> User involvement may be seen as a way of ensuring that research is more relevant to the groups that it intends to inform, or more appropriate to the communities it intends to serve. However, at a project level it is difﬁcult to show whether either of these aims have been achieved because it is not possible to know what the outcomes of the research might have been without the involvement of service users. [305]

#### Moraliskt argument att service users ska tilldelas en röst i forskning som påverkar deras hälsa 

> Irrespective of whether relevance to society can be demonstrated, there is a moral argument that service users should have a voice in research which may have an impact on their health status (Boote et al., 2002). [305]

#### Forskare erfar vissa svårigheter med att låta service users formulera ansökningar

> ...in the interviews we conducted, researchers reported difﬁculties with involving service users in writing proposals because of not wanting to raise service users’ expectations that the research would be funded, or not having the time or resources to do this. [305]

#### Etiskt tvivelaktigt att bland in service users innan etikansökan beviljats

> There is also an unresolved research governance issue about whether or not it is acceptable to involve service users before ethical approval has been obtained. [305]

#### Samtidig verkar tidig service user involvement kunna hjälpa till att identifiera potentiella etiska problem innan de uppstår 

> Previous research ﬁndings indicate that involvement at this stage can help to identify potential  ethical issues before they arise (Entwistle et al., 2002). [305]

#### I utvecklandet av enkäter kan service user involvement leda till högre svarsfrekvens

> In researcher-led studies, service users have been involved in developing and piloting data collection tools, designing questionnaires and deciding how data will be collected. In questionnaire design this can help to validate the questionnaire in terms of the language being used, the appropriateness of the questions being asked and the method of collection, leading to improved response rates (Nicolson et al., 2001). [305]

#### Involving service users in dissemination of research findings can have a powerful impact and make findings more accessible

> The literature suggests that involving service users in the dissemination of research ﬁndings, for example co-presenting a paper at a conference, can have a powerful impact and can make ﬁndings more accessible (see for example, Liberty et al., 1999; Flaskerud and Anderson, 1999). [306]

#### Involvement can have therapeutic outcomes for service users

> Policy documents and the research literature claim that there can be beneﬁts for service users who are involved in research (for example, DH, 2004; Baxter etal., 2001; Dixon et al., 1999). Such outcomes have beendescribed as therapeutic, and can be related to concepts of altruism (Agrawal, 2003). Accounts of research studies show that participation has helped some patients with cancer to construct their lives with greater meaning by providing a supportive structure and enabling hope (Moore, 2001).

#### Involving service users requires building greater flexibility into projects
> Involving service users requires building greater flexibility into projects, particularly in relation to timescales and the provision of additional support (Faulkner, 2004).

#### New forms of partnerships with service users in research raise new and different ethical issues

> The review found that new forms of partnerships with service users in research raise new and different ethical issues in relation to conﬁdentiality, anonymity, informed consent and protection from harm. Where service users are involved as co-researchers or active members of project teams there is a need to consider ethical issues both on the part of service users and to protect other participants in the research.



### Ethical and epistemic dilemmas in knowledge production: Addressing their intersection in collaborative, community-based research

#### Om Collaborative community-based research'(CCBR)

Här talas om 'Collaborative community-based research'(CCBR). Vad menas med det? Jo, det refererar till att...

> University researchers across a range of disciplines are increasingly collaborating with communities to investigate urgent social, economic, and policy problems. [p.24]

På vilket sätt tar sig detta samarbete sig uttryck? Jo...

> ...by involving community members as research partners instead of merely as research ‘subjects’ in the traditional sense. By co-developing research questions and carrying out the work in partnership with communities, scholars engaged in this type of research can help universities respond to calls to be more civically engaged [p. 24]

Det svarar mot krav på universiteten att bli mer samhällsengagerade i sin inriktning. Vidare beskrivs och motiveras denna typ av forskning så här:

> By drawing on community members’ local knowledge and experiences, CCBR both incorporates insights that may otherwise be overlooked and produces more relevant findings. Furthermore, CCBR can facilitate more inclusive public deliberations about important policy issues because it involves often-marginalized community members in knowledge production throughout the research process: from determining research questions, to gathering and interpreting data, to disseminating findings and developing policy proposals. [p. 24]

#### Syfte 

> In this article, we examine this growing type of empirical inquiry [CCBR] to understand its ethical and epistemic benefits and challenges, as well as its implications for research ethics more generally [p. 24]

Hur ämnar de då göra detta? Jo...

> ...we are not drawing upon empirical studies directly, but rather we are reflecting upon the benefits and challenges of one mode of empirical inquiry. We think this type of analysis represents an important and complementary form of philosophic engagement with empirical research: to reflect upon the dilemmas inherent in the research methodologies that scholars employ and, more foundationally, to identify how research can help mitigate systemic inequalities. [p. 25]

Metoden är alltså att "reflecting upon" i sann filosofisk tradition. Det de skriver här är att det finns dilemman som är "inherent in the research methodologies that scholars employ" samt implicit att det bör åligga forskningen att "help mitigate systemic inequalities" (vad som nu menas med det.) Jo, för att motivera eller redovisa varför de anser att det åligger universiteten att rikta in sig på detta skriver de sedan följande:

> In order to establish why such aims are relevant to scholarly research, we begin by considering the democratic mission of universities and the relationships among their ethical, epistemic, and political commitments. [p. 25]

#### Relationen mellan rättvisa och kunskapsproduktion är erkänd inom filosofin
> Philosophers have addressed relationships // among justice and knowledge production (e.g. Anderson, 1995), and at least since Dewey’s 1916 Democracy and Education (Dewey, 2011) they have attended to how social scientific inquiry can support democratic practices (e.g. Anderson, 2006; Bohman, 1999). There has also been growing attention by philosophers to the ethical nature of epistemic practices. [ref. 1] [p. 24-25]

#### Universities and justice in knowledge production

> In her 1995 article ‘The Democratic University: The Role of Justice in the Production of Knowledge’, Elizabeth Anderson addresses the politics in higher education from an egalitarian perspective. She argues that conservative allegations that universities are hostage to liberal ideology are misguided in their assumption that knowledge production can be an apolitical process.

Här föreligger en felaktig slutsats skulle jag säga, dock utan att ha läst Elizabeth Andersons text. Men om konservativa anklagar universitet för att vara gisslan hos en liberal ideologi betyder ju inte det i sig att de menar att kunskapsproduktion kan och bör vara apolitisk om de inte uttryckligen säger det. Det borde ju vara fullt möjligt att vara konservativ och socialkonstruktionist, eller? 

Hur som helst, så här redovisas Andersons argumentation om varför universitet oundvikligen ör politiska institutioner:

> Universities are political, she agrees, but not because of partisan commitments. Rather, they are unavoidably political institutions because inquiry is a social endeavor and thereby implicates foundational political questions about membership and communication within universities. Anderson notes that inquiry is a social pursuit in at least three primary ways: because we test our findings against the metrics of others, because there is a social criterion of publicity for what counts as reasons to believe (we cannot simply command others to believe), and because discoveries and new insights must be verified by others to be accepted (p. 190). That is, ‘what one believes crucially depends on whom one believes’ (Anderson, 1995: 189). Therefore, the task at hand, she argues, is not to remove politics from the university but rather to determine what ‘political epistemology’ the university should embrace given its mission of generating warranted knowledge claims.

Jag tycker att detta är mycket klokt och håller åtminstone så långt med henne. Vidare skriver de att Anderson förkastar en libertariansk modell eftersom den...

> ...is vulnerable to failures in the marketplace of ideas when some individuals are denied access to forums for inquiry, when the equality of some inquirers is undermined, or when constraints on certain content or types of speech contribute to the circulation of false or unwarranted claims (Anderson, 1995: 196–197).

Exakt vad som utmärker en libertariansk modell och vad som skiljer den från en liberal är för mig oklart men jag tolkar det som att i den förra så är det ett hårdare och inte lika inkluderande debattklimat utan mer principen att den starkes röst vinner. Enligt författarna så endorsar Anderson istället en liberaldemokratisk epistemiologi som...

>...is predicated on competent adults’ universal access to the academy and their egalitarian participation in inquiry (p. 203). [p. 26]

En epistemiologi som bejakar mångfalden och där...

> We obviously should reject hierarchies that are irrelevant to epistemic concerns and are themselves unethical [...] such as giving more credence to the claims of White males and discounting the claims of working class individuals or minorities (p. 204). [p. 26]

Men artikelförfattarna riktar kritik mot Andersons synsätt främst eftersom de anser att...

> ...her university-centric account overlooks knowledge forms that emerge or exist outside the disciplined halls of academe, as well as the possibility of academic knowledge production that includes the broader public. [p. 26]

samt att hon...

> ...does not go far enough in grasping how authorized knowledge (including that sanctioned by universities) as well as ‘common sense’ (Gramsci, 1992) can impose epistemic injustices.[p. 26]

Vidare skriver de att hennes...

> ...positive view still falls short of recognizing the wealth of knowledge of individuals outside the academy who do not seek the forms of membership and participation she writes of (and who may even have strategic reasons for not making their knowledge known to such institutions). It also falls short of recognizing other sorts of ethical and epistemic responsibilities universities might have, particularly with regard to disadvantaged communities.

#### Freires frigörande pedagogik

Artikelförfattarna beskriver Freires 'liberatory pedagogy' så här:

> Freire’s liberatory pedagogy, through which those who suffer from injustice ‘know better // what they already know’ and ‘name’ their reality for themselves (Freire, 1970; Glass, 2001). [p. 28-29]

Och kommenterar den så här att:

> Such critical knowledge production can expand the hermeneutical resources for all members of the community and is an important contribution to the balancing of the scales of epistemic justice. [p. 29]

Med andra ord att t.ex. den minoritet som varit utsatt för något övergrepp tillåts och tilldelas resurser att sätta ord på den och spride den kunskapen till en bredare allmänhet. Och att denna kunskap utgör ett viktigt bidrag i arbetet för epistemisk rättvisa. 


#### Kritik mot Frickers teoriom epistemisk orättvisa
De gör en mycket bra sammanfattning av Miranda Frickers teori om epistemisk orättvisa men riktar samtidigt en kritik mot den då de tycker att hon missar att...

> ...the exclusion of knowledge forms outside the sphere of propositional knowledge that is sanctioned by the university could itself be considered as a kind of both testimonial and hermeneutic epistemic injustices. It is a form of testimonial injustice when, because of identity prejudice, people’s claims are dismissed as ‘mere’ intuitions, vague feelings, or the like. This testimonial injustice transmutes into a form of hermeneutical injustice – one that Fricker has yet to recognize – when those very people who are ideologically demeaned as knowers (e.g. women, people of color) are thereby denied the opportunity to reinterpret the world for themselves and others. In this respect, Fricker’s notion of hermeneutical injustice undervalues the knowledge already possessed by marginalized individuals or communities and thereby fails to consider how that knowledge can be mobilized (such as through CCBR). [p. 29]

#### Kritik mot universitetens negligerande av kunskap från 'disadvantaged communities' och ett förordande av CCBR som "an essential approach for combating epistemic injustice in scholarly research"

> Scholars largely generate their research questions in isolation from disadvantaged communities (even if they share identity markers with those communities) and in conversation with previously published research that, for all the reasons // of epistemic injustice we have reviewed, itself excludes the knowledge, interests, and concerns of those communities. Thus, scholars may produce many volumes of ‘damage-centered research’ (Tuck, 2009) about the impacts of US mass incarceration on communities of color, but they produce vastly less research on those communities’ resilience and modes of being that are not defined by dominant ideologies and institutions. [p. 31-32]

> In contrast,equity-oriented CCBR begins with the knowledge, questions, and interests of communities and develops research programs that investigate issues otherwise outside the attention of the dominant culture. [p. 32]

> In practice, this means that CCBR involves multiple iterative processes that reside at the ethico-epistemic intersection. Whether determining research questions, obtaining informed consent, gathering data, or reporting findings, researchers must engage in ongoing conversations with community partners to actualize respectful and egalitarian working relationships. Both the structure and the operations of the research project must be iteratively fine-tuned to enable the discernment of shared goals, of mutually meaningful and significant research questions, and of possibilities for ethically, epistemically, and politically transformative engagements. This relational, iterative process stands in stark contrast to the transactional mode of research whereby researchers define the parameters of the work apart from their subjects and then obtain consent from them as a discrete transaction (Newman and Glass, 2014a, 2014b). [p. 34]

> Neither Fricker nor Anderson recognizes a possibility for scholars and community members to collaborate in this kind of formal knowledge production to enrich public knowledge. Thus, they do not recognize how to further epistemic justice through partnerships that respect individuals outside the academy as knowledge-bearers and knowledge-producers, not merely as research subjects. We believe that this is an essential approach for combating epistemic injustice in scholarly research. [p. 32]




#### Slutsatser

> Collaborative community-based research can bring a range of benefits to universities, communities, and the public more broadly. [p. 23]

> CCBR importantly recognizes that epistemic and ethical dimensions of research are entangled with one another. [p. 24]

> A distinct virtue of collaborative community-based research is that it makes the ethical–epistemic intersections and challenges in research a focal point of its methodology. This makes collaborative community-based research well positioned to address various forms of ‘epistemic injustice’ (Fricker, 2007) that demean certain people and groups as knowers and exclude them from knowledge production. [p. 23]

> Our analysis leads us to argue that universities should support CCBR for both epistemic and ethical reasons and for the benefits that accrue to the broader public. [p. 24]



###  Social impact of participatory health research: collaborative non-linear processes of knowledge mobilization

Artikel är ingen sedvanlig akademisk artikel utan mer som en lång plädering för...

> ...how health researchers can achieve social impact for a wide audience, involving them in a non-linear process of joint learning on urgent problems recognized by the various stakeholders in public health.

Detta kan enligt artikelförfattarna åstadkommas genom en samling metoder som faller under paraplybegreppet *participatory health research* vars...

> impact is not preordained by one group of stakeholders, but the result of a process of reflection and dialog with multiple stakeholders on what counts as valuable outcomes. This knowledge mobilization and winding pathway embarked upon during such research have the potential for impact along the way as opposed to the expectation that impact will occur merely at the end of a research project.

#### Knowledge transfer vs. knowledge mobilization

Ur en teoretisk synvinkel innehåller artikeln mycket klokt  t.ex. i sin kritik av en linjär modell för akademisk kunskapsproduktion här:

> Another issue is related to the route to achieving social impact. This is usually conceptualized as a process of knowledge transfer (Van De Ven and Johnson 2006). Academic researchers are conceived as the ones who start the process of knowledge production which is then passed on to and applied in practice. Critics point out that the production and application of knowledge is far more complex then this linear model suggests, and has argued that knowledge ‘mobilization’ is a better way to capture how knowledge is generated in complex networks. Realizing impact is in this vision not just an intellectual process and transfer, but also a socio-political activity of knowledge mobilization embedded in heterogeneous societal networks with many different stakeholders.

Den innehåller mycket bra teori, t.ex. vävs Freire, Fricker och Nowotny in och det är inte i många artiklar de nämns samtidigt, men den är ockå lite tröttsamt teoretisk eftersom den mest rabblar på om teori och egentligen inte utgör någon form av studie utan som sagt en lång form av plädering för varför PHR är att föredra framför andra metoder.

Syftet med artikeln är:

> to discuss the complexities of whether and how the amelioration of epistemic injustices are being served through community engagement activities [p. 363]

Det är en mycket personlig redogörelse för en forskares erfarenhet av att vara med och driva 'engaged research' och vad hon upplever att det har resulterat i för bidrag, akademiskt för communityn och de som var inblandade samt för henne själv.

#### 'Participation' - a buzz word in development studies

> The term ‘participation’ within this context warrants exploration and discussion. Within the literature and debates in development studies in particular, the term participation has become contentious, and seen as a ‘buzz word’, given the misappropriation of the term for political or ideological agendas. // Participation has, in many projects been used as synonymous with mere consultation [p. 364-365]

#### Ingående beskrivning av vad 'participatory research' och 'engaged research' bör innefatta enligt artikelförfattaren

> Within this context, it is important to ask what participation within a research project could, or perhaps should, amount to? Arguably, as with engagement, participation could occur within a spectrum depending on the project, the goals and the methodology employed. At a minimum, participation requires the active involvement of participants in the research project, where being active would amount to participants understanding the research project, as well as commitment to and investment in at least some of the research process and outcomes. But, I think the underlying principles driving what can be seen as ‘participatory research’ requires researchers to problematise the power differentials of research by fully involve their participants in the research processes which are, often unreflectively, conducted ‘independently’ and which are typically inaccessible to participants. The challenges arising from this new way of doing research are a source for rich debate. Participatory research as central to engaged research processes, and aligning with the goals of addressing epistemic justice through engagement, strive to bring out the strengths of researchers and ‘participants’ as they work in a partnership for research through which the balance of power inherent in the knowledge generation process is challenged (see Horowitz, Robinson, & Seifer, 2009 for a discussion of participation in these terms). [p. 365]

> Following this, engaged research, at least in principle, provides an important way for higher education institutions to challenge and undermine epistemic injustices by respecting individuals and communities outside of the traditional academic boundaries as ‘knowledge-bearers’, ‘knowledge producers’ and participants in the research process in a very real sense, rather than merely ‘research subjects’ sources of data or knowledge recipients (Glass & Newman, 2015, p. 32). Perhaps most importantly, engaged research is built on the normative principle of what Visvanathan has called cognitive justice 2 : embracing a plurality of knowledges from diverse perspectives of legitimate epistemic agents who enter into dialogue with one another within a research relationship (Davies, 2016). Through the promotion of cognitive/epistemic justice, engaged research practices opening up the knowledge economy to those who were previously barred from playing an active role in it. [p. 365]


#### Artikelförfattarens självreflekterande 'Concluding remarks'

> In the evolution of our engaged research project we had come a long way in developing participatory practices and approaches, interrogating how we viewed and harnessed the epistemic agency of our participants in the knowledge generation process to further our collective goals for social change. While we had come to recognise the community workshops, theatre initiative and dialogue sessions as important parts of the knowledge generation and knowledge dissemination processes, I think it is still a matter of contention and debate amongst our colleagues in the academy as to whether the legitimacy of these approaches is to be recognised and valued ‘academically’. While the aims and the impact of this project was applauded, and indeed celebrated, the initial phase of the research project remained, in most of our colleagues’ eyes, the most interesting, valid and valuable aspect of the project in terms of research findings. Similarly, in reporting on the project, the academic outputs (conference papers, reports, book chapters) remained what the institution and funders deemed relevant to the knowledge outputs of the project. We had of course produced these standard and ‘legitimate’ outputs, though we had not produced any of them collaboratively with our partners or participants. In one instance we had tried to involve our partners in a presentation at the university, but they backed out of // participation on the day we were going to present, and although they gave us a number of reasons for this, I still wonder about the explicit or implicit reasons not expressed – whether they saw any value in this activity when they had been so involved in the other community based knowledge dissemination projects which were more participatory in style and directly linked to the local community, or whether they felt intimidated by the academic audience. [p. 369-370]

> Through our engagement with other members of the university community in relation to this project, I have come to doubt that we could fully undermine the scepticism about engaged research and epistemic prejudice through presenting arguments, giving more workshops on what engaged research methodologies entail or even by highlighting and rewarding the positive effects of engaged research projects. I think that much of the work that needs to be done in the academy is to understand how research practices can be harnesses to undo the epistemic injustice that has been perpetuated (and continues to be perpetuated) by academe. From my own experience, achieving this will arguably require a more human face – sharing personal narratives of change through engagement as well as having academics experience these changes themselves through doing, possibly by unwittingly blundering into, community engaged and participatory projects through which they may come to challenge their own ways of being, perceiving and knowing. Perhaps, it will require that we build a critical mass of academics and researchers who not only profess to follow engaged research methodologies, but who take the democratisation of the knowledge production process seriously and who are willing to uncover and reject epistemic injustices in the modern academy. Such academics and researchers are, I think, those who are bold enough to challenge their preconceived ideas, brave enough to constantly interrogate as well as analyse their own practices and refine them in light of critical reflection, and honest enough to learn how to do things differently as they admit to and then confront their mistakes and failures. In seeking to transform how we do our own research, we should, I think, strive to cultivate the kind of ‘slow and “care-full” scholarship’ (Temper & Bene, 2016, p. 46) as well as academic humility that will allow us to become these kinds of academics. In doing this I suspect that we will also become the kind of academics that community based organisations will be more willing to engage with in meaningful collaborations. [p. 370]

Tycker mycket om hennes reflektioner måste jag säga. Så personligt och så mycket självinsikt vilar i de orden.

### Hermeneutical injustice and the Social Sciences: Development policy and positional objectivity

Artikeln väcker frågor i vilken mån det finns en objektiv rättvisa eller om vad som är 'objektivt' rättvist är en fråga som är relativ och beroende av utsiktsplats och tillhörighet. Det knyter an till kritiken mot Roslings framgångshistorier där länders utveckling avgränsas till att handla om vissa begränsade mått på välstånd men där blicken inriktad skogen kan skymma mycket annat. 

> The question is: what hermeneutical resources do we need to understand the various possible perspectives that is both epistemically correct and just? These conceptual resources no doubt require us to pay attention to gender and geography, to class and community, as well as to the needs and limitations of the institutions that seek to solve the problem. Here, certain types of participatory research create the opportunity to create concepts and measurements that are in Nowotny’s sense “socially robust,” so that their “validity is no longer determined solely, or predominantly, by narrowly circumscribed scientific communities, but by much wider communities of engagement comprising knowledge producers, disseminators, traders, and users” (Nowotney, Scott, and Gibbons 2003, 192). [p. 197]

> Consider, for instance, an important attempt to achieve hermeneutically virtuous social sciences. The “Voices of the Poor” project was initiated in late 1990s precisely to give the poor a chance to conceptualize the conditions that they regarded as necessary for their own well-being. Here is one poignant complaint from the collection of stories: “Kanyama is a very big compound and yet there is only one clinic which is situated in New Kanyama (some 5 kilometres away). How can one walk all this long distance when one is ill? It becomes a very big problem when one falls sick at night because the security situation is very bad here”, said a woman of Kanyama compound in Lusaka. (Zambia; World Bank 1999) Even measurements of per-capita healthcare services do not necessarily capture the difficulties involved in using the services. Security, location, and even the illness in question can radically change the possibilities for receiving help.

Det författaren således gör på ett intressant sätt är att föreslå en ihopkopplng mellan "socially robost knowledge" och "epistemic (och då främst hermeneutical) injustice". Det är en intressant tanke och en intressant strävan som sätter fingret på vem som ska tilldelas makten att t.ex. uttala sig om ett lands sociala och ekonomiska utveckling och hur den ter sig. Kritiken som genomsyrar artikeln är att världen styrs och betraktas "objektivt" utifrån en nyliberal hegemoni som tror sig beskriva saker objektivt men som i själva verket har starkt begränsade och färgade glasögon i sin blick på världen.

Men min motfråga är om det verkligen är möjligt att prata om en rättvisa som inte är relativ och subjektivt grundad och som mer kan beskrivas i form av objektiva fakta eller såsom socialt robust kunskap. Jag vet nog för lite om framför allt socialt robust kunskap för att kunna uttala mig om det. Men spontant tror jag det är svårt. Det kontextuellt beroende är svårt att abstrahera och generalisera. Här är ju också en skiljelinje mellan positivister och socialkonstuktionister i synen på vad som utgör kunskap.

### Participatory research and the philosophy of social science: Beyond the moral imperative


#### Participatory research approaches enhance validity
> It is argued that participatory research approaches enhance validity because they address the participative, social and relational nature of human action. [p. 546]

> ...the  participatory and inclusive nature of the participatory processes means that there is the potential for multiple voices and perspectives on an issue to be voiced, thus accessing what Hajdukowski-Ahmed (1998) refers to as the multiplicity of ways  of  knowing  and  uttering.  Constructions  of  reality  are  thus  not  just those of the individual mind, but manifest through the “reflective action of persons and communities” (Reason, 1994, p. 333). There is thus the possibility that the knowledge produced corresponds to the complexity of social interaction (Hajdukowski-Ahmed, 1998). The validity of PR thus resides in its collaborative and experiential nature and how it addresses the participative, relational, and social nature of human action. [p. 560]



### Engagement as co-constructing knowledge: A moral necessity in public health research

#### Sammanfattning av vad denna artikel argumenterar för

> This article makes the normative argument that... [co‐construction of knowledge]... is necessary to achieve the foundational moral aims of public health research — building relations of equality and addressing the health needs of those considered disadvantaged — which reflect the field's underlying commitment to social justice. [p. 805]

> It will argue that co‐constructing knowledge is necessary to achieve the moral aims of public health research. (Whether co‐constructing knowledge advances the moral aims of other types of health research is beyond the scope of the article.)

Viktigt att poängtera att här handlar det alltså om folkhälsa och inte hälsa mer generellt. 

#### A philosophical rationale for why researchers should perform engagement in health research has not been provided before

> A philosophical rationale for why researchers should perform engagement in health research as the co‐construction of knowledge has thus far not been provided by ethics scholars, though some normative work has been done in other disciplines like development studies and community‐based participatory research (CBPR) in support of undertaking it. [ref. 21] [p. 806]

#### The two moral aims of public health research

> Two core moral aims of public health research are: (a) addressing  the health needs of those who are considered disadvantaged and (b) building relations of equality by supporting self‐determination. These aims are identified by both theories of social justice and feminist ethics. [ref. 28]

#### Young's account of social justice

> Young's account of social justice [...] calls for furthering two key values: participating in determining one's or society's actions (self‐determination) and developing and exercising one's capacities (self‐development). [ref. 34] Denial of the former constitutes domination, while denial of the latter constitutes oppression. [ref. 35] [p. 808]

[35] Young, I. M. (1990). Justice and the politics of difference. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.

#### What self-determination means

> Self‐determination means that all those who are significantly affected by a problem and its solution are included in discussions and decision‐making about it. [ref. 40] ‘Significantly affected’ refers to those whose options for action would be substantially conditioned by the decision—namely, those whose basic interests would be affected by the decision. [ref. 41] [p. 808]


#### Three ways in which co‐constructing knowledge advances the two moral aims of public health research

> It next identifies and discusses three ways in which co‐constructing knowledge advances those moral aims: by facilitating self‐determination, supporting individuals’ right to research, and maximizing social knowledge to address cognitive and epistemic injustice. Objections to the arguments presented in the article are then articulated and defended against. [p. 805]


##### How co-constructing knowledge facilitates self-determination

> Whether and how members of society can meet their health needs is impacted by what preventative interventions are available and affordable to them. Co‐constructing knowledge in public health research thus enables members of society to participate in decisions that affect their basic interests. They can assert control over the research projects that affect them. [ref. 44] Within a society, those signifi‐ // cantly affected by public health research would include people living in the research setting or people who are part of the groups and populations of focus in such projects. [p. 808-809] 

##### How co-constructing knowledge supports the right to research

> [Arjun Appadurai] argues that research should be recognized as a right of a special kind owed to all members of society — namely, the triple capacity to inquire, to analyze, and to communicate. [ref. 51] It is the capacity to make disciplined, systematic inquiries into those things we need to know about our own lives and worlds in order to gain strategic knowledge. [p. 809]

> The co‐construction of public health knowledge supports research users and beneficiaries’ realization of their right to research [...] Being involved in decision‐making over each stage of the public health research process would build their ability to formulate research questions, collect and analyze data,and disseminate research findings. [p. 809]

##### How co-constructing knowledge maximizes social knowledge

> Even where problems of global social injustice are recognized, existing approaches formulated and developed by Western modernity are not solving them. [ref. 69] Modes, models, means, and ends of social transformation are potentially much vaster than those identified by modern science. Ways of knowing beyond Western modernity can identify other forms of knowledge that point to additional ways of intervening. [ref. 70] Maximizing the social knowledge base used to de velop interventions by pooling the knowledge of all social positions will construct a more comprehensive account of how social processes work and the likely consequences of proposed interventions. Here, the situated knowledge of those marginalized by social institu tions and norms is identified as an especially vital resource. [ref. 71] It is thus imperative to capture the immense existing variety of knowledges and practices to maximize our transformative potential. Without cognitive and epistemic justice, larger struggles for social justice will not be realized. [ref. 72] [p. 810]

> Co‐constructing knowledge comprises a way of drawing out epistemologies of the South and maximizing the social knowledge base. It can help address global social injustice by making sense of aspects of marginalized social groups’ social experiences that are obscured from understanding and identifying new ways of intervening to address complex problems based on multiple ways of knowing. As such, this form of engagement is well‐suited to the field of public health research. [p. 810]

##### How informing does not maximize social knowledge

> In contrast, informing does not comprise a way of drawing out epistemologies of the South or the situated knowledge of the disadvantaged. [p. 811]

##### How consulting is not maximizing social knowledge

> Consultations have been shown to enrich the knowledge researchers use to identify the problems facing communities. [ref. 81] However, unlike co‐constructing knowledge, the capacity of consultations to support intercultural translation is questionable. The development of new constellations of public health knowledge will rest solely with researchers using information derived from those considered disadvantaged. Any new knowledge will be constructed by researchers rather than being a joint product of dialogue and translation. This may limit such knowledge's transformative potential. It also means that only researchers’ understanding of the problem will be broadened rather than both parties’ understanding being enriched. [p. 811]

#### Possible objections

##### Social justice is not a foundational value of public health 

> If social justice is not a foundational (or at least an important) value for public health research, then adopting a form of engagement that furthers such a value is not essential to the field. In response, it is important to note that social justice has been identified as a foundational value in numerous public health ethics frameworks. [ref. 82] There seems to be strong convergence amongst ethics scholars and public health practitioners that advancing social justice is a core goal of the field of public health. [p. 811]

Hon säger att om nu inte social justice är ett grundläggande värde i folkälsoforskning så har forskning genom  co-creation of knowledge...

> can advance other ethical values underlying public health: procedural justice, population level utility (advancing community well‐being), solidarity, and community trust. [p. 811]


##### Other forms of engagement can advance other moral values of public health research equally or more effectively than the co-construction of knowledge

> This is potentially  true and requires further exploration that is beyond the scope of this work. The article is not disputing the value of other forms of engagement or saying that co‐constructing knowledge is the only form of engagement that should be performed in public health research. Instead, it is hoped that the arguments presented show readers why such a form of engagement is necessary in the field of public health research to advance its moral aims relating to social justice. [p. 812]

##### Undertaking engagement as the co‐construction of knowledge creates significant burdens on research users and beneficiaries that are disproportionate to the benefits they will accrue.

Här skriver hon att detta må vara fallet men att det finns sätt att involvera dessa disadvantaged i denna typ av forskning som säkerställer att deras basala behov uppfylls, t.ex. genom att tilldela dem en lön eller ersättning för deras deltagande. Om detta inte går att uppbåda utan bördan är större än den förmodade belöningen så kan det vara oetiskt att bedriva denna typ av forskning och då får man försöka hitta andra individer/grupper att forska tillsammans med.

#### Any substantial increase in public health research being performed as the co‐construction of knowledge will require significant changes to the research environment

Som svar på det skriver hon:

> While appreciating that making structural changes to the funding and education sectors will be a challenging and politically fraught process, effecting such shifts seems necessary to get closer to solving the complex problems with which public health grapples. [p. 812]






#### Three forms of engagement used in research projects enligt författaren

Artikelförfattaren listar tre sorters engagemang i forskningsprojekt:

- Informing
- Consulting
- Co-construction of knowledge

#### Vad 'co-construction of knowledge' betyder i sammanhanget

Artikelförfattaren skriver att co-construction of knowledge betyder att:

> ...researchers jointly construct knowledge with research users and beneficiaries; all parties design and conduct research together in ways that achieve the porposes of both sets of actors. It entails shared decision-making in all phases of research projects. Co-constructing knowledge is also a process of bringing together multiple kinds of knowledge and multiple perspectives to construct an understanding of research phenomena based on a plurality of situated knowledges. This includes knowledge and perspectives of those outside the research sector: research users and beneficiaries, be they members of communities, businesses, governments, or activist organisations.[p. 806]

#### Vad 'consulting' betyder i sammanhanget

> [Consulting] is characterizd by research users and beneiciaries being invited to give their input (feedback, suggestions, and critiques) on aspects of research projects but with no assurance that it will be used by those who decide. [...] Often, their consultation occurs through specifically established advisory groups. [p. 806]

#### Vad 'informing' betyder i sammanhanget 

> Informing means raising awareness and understanding of what research is and of already defined research projects within host communities or populations. Research users and beneficiaries are told of the outputs of decision-making in research projects but do not inform the process or decisions in any way. [p. 806]


#### Sharp and Foster's spectrum of power sharing in health research

Artikelförfattaren refererar till Sharp och Fosters spectrum of power sharing in health research:

> Sharp and Foster describe a spectrum of power sharing in health research, from community dialogue through community consultation and approval to full partnership, where the latter implies the greatest community empowerment. [ref. 5] [p. 805]

#### Tindana et al.'s 'community consultation' vs. 'collaborative partnership'

Artikelförfattaren refererar till Tindana et al.'s 'community consultation' vs. 'collaborative partnership':

> Tindana et al. distinguish between 'community consultation' and 'collaborative partnership', which means involving local stakeholders in assessing local health problems; planning, conducting // and overseeing research; and integrating research into the health care system. [ref. 7] [p. 805-806]

### Responsible research, inequality in science and epistemic injustice: an attempt to open up thinking about inclusiveness in the context of RI/RRI

I artikeln argumenterar Koch för att:

> it is time to start an interdisciplinary conversation and consider an inward dimension of responsible research: a collective duty to care for diversity and address inequalities within the scientific field. [p. 672]

Men jag tycker att hennes argument är rätt svaga och det jag främst tog med mig är att hon refererar till följande artikel:

> Dübgen, Franziska. 2020. “Scientiﬁc Ghettos and Beyond. Epistemic Injustice in Academia and Its Eﬀects on Researching Poverty.” In Dimensions of Poverty: Measurement, Epistemic Injustices, Activism, edited by V. Beck, H. Hahn, and R. Lepenies, 77–95. Berlin: Springer.

Detta kan eventuellt vara ett intressant bokkapitel att läsa.


###  What difference does patient and public involvement make and what are its pathways to impact? Qualitative study of patients and researchers from a cohort of randomised clinical trials


#### Resultatet

> None of our informants identified PPI as having an unfavourable impact on the trial. Of the 21 CIs [chief investigators] interviewed, 14 described PPI as having an impact and seven explicitly stated that they felt PPI had not made an impact

> According to informants, the opportunity for PPI to make a difference was influenced by two main factors: whether chief investigators had goals and plans for PPI and the quality of the relationship between the research team and the PPI contributors. Early involvement of PPI contributors and including them in responsive (e.g. advisory groups) and managerial (e.g. trial management groups) roles were more likely to achieve impact compared to late involvement and oversight roles (e.g. trial steering committees).

#### Slutsatser

> Those seeking to enhance PPI in trials should develop goals for PPI at an early stage that fits the needs of the trial, plan PPI implementation in accordance with these goals, invest in developing good relationships between PPI contributors and researchers, and favour responsive and managerial roles for contributors in preference to oversight-only roles. These features could be used by research funders in judging PPI in trial grant applications and to inform policies to optimise PPI within trials.

#### Bra referenser från introduktionen

##### PPI in research justified in two main ways

> PPI in research has been justified in two main ways: normatively on moral, ethical or political grounds consistent with slogans like “nothing about us without us”[10,11], and substantively in terms of the PPI potential to benefit research [10].

##### Indications that PPI can have favourable impacts

> There are indications that PPI can have favourable impacts upon every stage of the research process [13,15–19] by helping to ensure that research funds are appropriately prioritised, that research evidence is relevant to patients, and by improving recruitment and retention rates and supporting the uptake of research in practice.

### Engaging the oldest old in research: lessons from the Newcastle 85+ study

#### Rationale

> In order to guarantee that the future care provided to our ageing populations is grounded in the best quality evidence, it is imperative that researchers ensure their study populations are representative and include the oldest old, the most rapidly expanding sector of the population.

> Older people, especially those over 75 and those in care homes, are often unjustifiably excluded from studies [ref. 24-26].

#### Syfte

> In this paper, we report some of the challenges of, and successful strategies for, involving, recruiting and retaining this important age group [= Those aged 85 and over = the oldest old] in research studies.


#### Resultat

De listar följande challenges och successful strategies:

- **Initial participant approach**. An initial invitation
from a known health care professional may lead to
more confusion than a letter from the study team.
Photographs of researchers are useful additions to
study information sheets. Adequate time for recruit-
ment and data collection should be factored into
planning.

- **Engagement with family and care home staff**.
Additional time and resources are needed, especially
with the oldest old, to engage with family carers and
other gatekeepers such as care home staff for those
people living in care. Researchers should be trained
and supported to ensure that complex situations are
handled with sensitivity.

- **Significant cognitive impairment is an issue**;
due consideration must been given to the relevant
ethical and legal issues, including assessment of
capacity and consent procedures. The use of pro-
tocols to assess capacity and to secure consent
should be developed. Training for researchers in the
assessment of capacity and seeking informed consent
should be mandatory.

- **Minimising participant burden**. Home visits are
preferred by this population and may enable the par-
ticipation of those who are frail or housebound.
Consequently researchers’ travel costs, specialised
portable equipment and availability of chaperones
may need to be costed into the research. The need
for, and the cost of, several, shorter visits to assess
capacity, secure consent and collect all relevant data
should be anticipated.

- **Participant withdrawal**. Researchers should
endeavour to make the research process as flexible
as possible and may wish to consider the option of
study suspension as an alternative to withdrawal as
often the participant does not wish to withdraw per-
manently but cannot accommodate study visits at
that particular time due to other commitments.

- **Communication with participants after study
cessation**. The oldest old may derive benefits, such
as opportunities for increased socialisation, from
participation in research. The process of study close-
out should be considered at the onset so that partici-
pants are not left with a feeling of loss. A communi-
cation strategy to update participants about the
study progress and findings after their involvement
ceases can be helpful.

- **Engagement with stakeholders and the media**.
Researchers should consider the need to engage with
not only local clinicians, but also with older people’s
voluntary organisations, the media and the local
press. This should be proactively built into the study
recruitment protocol.


### Using a participatory action research approach as a process for promoting the health of older people

Inte tillräckligt relevant för min studie
    
### Beyond tokenistic involvement of older people in research -- a framework for future development and understanding

#### Rationale

> Research and development work in health and social care are increasingly required to involve users at all stages of the research process yet there is scant empirical evidence to support the justification of this laudable aim. Evidence does suggest that at present efforts to achieve this are primarily tokenistic and that more work is needed, both to examine what user involvement in research activity actually means, and how this can best be supported.


#### Syfte

> This paper sets out to describe developments to support involvement of older people through work at the Royal Bank of Scotland Centre for the Older Person’s Agenda and to identify a number of challenges that this has raised for researchers. These challenges have arisen out of a number of assumptions that underpin the process of user involvement. The paper discusses some of the benefits of working in partnership with older people and identifies strategic issues for consideration in order to promote future partnership working.

#### Några slutsatser och reflektioner av artikelförfattarna kring user involvement


##### Varför och hur aktiviteter utförs snarare än att de utförs  avgör graden av user involvement
> Authors have tried to unpick definitions of involvement by representing it as levels along a continuum. The consumer model of participation would sit at one end of the continuum, with an empowerment model at the other. The difficulty with representing user involvement in this way is that it defines involvement as a set of activities rather than addressing some of the principles that should guide involvement. It does not take into account key questions about the nature of relationships in the research process. [p. 51]

Bra reflektion. Istället för att att definiera graden av involvement baserat på vilken slags aktivitet det rör sig om bör fokus ligga på "the principles that should guide involvement" och "key questions about the nature of relationships in the research process" eftersom det är mer avgörande för graden av engagemang. Det de vill poängtera här är att graden av user involvement avgörs inte blott av att du gör en viss aktivitet utan varför och hur du utför den på ett visst sätt.

##### Can research be done by anyone and can we disregard the experiences of the researcher?

> Is it true that everyone can do research? If so why do we spend money and effort preparing academics to learn and gain extensive experience in this activity? What does doing research with users actually mean? Is everyone doing the same thing? It is not clear in the literature what is exactly meant by involvement of users in research. [p. 51]

En högst relevant fråga. Dock har artikeln några år på nacken vilket gör det tveksamt om det är lämpligt att referera till att detta utgör det nuvarande kunskapsläget.

##### Dangerous to assume that older people want control over the research process rather than for example a partnership
> Literature that has identified different models of involvement and has described various levels of involvement ranging from // seeking views at one end to empowerment of older people who in turn have control over research at the other. When this is presented as a ladder (for example Hoyes & Means, 1993; Reed et al., 2004), the empowerment model sits at the top, implying that this is the gold standard in partnership/involvement activity. Few of these models have been developed with older people and it would be dangerous to assume that older people want control over the research process rather than for example a partnership, where knowledge and skills of all parties are shared and valued. There is no evidence to suggest that research made by older people has better outcomes than research made in partnership. [p. 51-52]

##### Det finns oklarheter kring vad som egentligen motiverar äldre att vara med i forskning och vilken form av lärande de egentligen får ut av ett sådant engagemang

> The motivation to become involved in research and development activities is not always clear. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the drivers for older people’s motivation to become involved include: wanting to give something back to their communities; wanting stimulation; having time on their hands; and wanting to make a difference. The emphasis in this evidence lies more heavily in the ‘giving’ domain rather than the receiving. Does this mean that only certain people will become involved in such an activity? What is the link between this motivation to become involved and where the power driving the activity ultimately lies? Gilbert (2004, p. 306) argues that ‘the power relationships remain stacked in favour of the professionals who retain specialist knowledge and value positions’. More attention needs to be paid to reciprocity and a commitment to learning in the process of involvement in research and development. [p. 52]

#### Six key issues emerged needed to be considered in the development of any programme of involvement

> By considering these assumptions six key issues emerged that needed to be considered in the development of any programme of involvement:

+ adopt a systematic approach to recording the processes and
outcomes of involvement with older people – remain crit-
ical – be open to the possibility that it may not be a good
thing;
+ consider a set of principles rather than levels of involve-
ment that are important to guide the process. These prin-
ciples must emphasize equality and fairness, a clear sense of
purpose and roles, and a commitment to learning;
+ debate what the role of the older person in the partnership
process is, and what skills they may therefore need;
+ work with older people to explore their beliefs and values
underpinning research and learning;
+ work with older people to explore what type of partnership
they want;
+ consider techniques and approaches to involvement that
would promote equal partnerships.


#### Övriga reflektioner och tankar framåt

> Formalizing the role of older people who work in partnership with the Centre to be one of ‘associate’ would enable them to have a formal role within the Centre and be offered regular opportunities to use their knowledge and skills in practice.

Detta är ju något som vi på CASE har gjort genom vårt brukarråd.

> Education programmes for professionals on how to facilitate involvement need to be developed. It should not be assumed that this is easy and that facilitators do not need support in developing these complex skills. In addition there needs to be a change in attitude of professionals towards partnership working with older people whereby professionals need to recognize the potential research expertise of users and to work with this.

Detta ovan  är viktigt. Bara för att vi är professorer och forskare betyder det inte att även vi måste lära oss vissa skills för att detta ska fungera. Vi måste också reflektera över hur jämlika relationerna egentligen är mellan oss och de som vi involverar. 

> Further development of theory that guides involvement is a priority. At present much of the theory that guides practice in relation to involvement is based on different levels of involvement in the partnership process. Theory, however, does not address the different types of support that are required at these levels, nor does it reflect organizational and process issues inherent in involvement (Reed et al., 2004).

(Se citat ovan) Vad krävs det för typ av stöd för att utföra involvering på en viss nivå eller på ett viss sätt som säkerställer att uppgiften utförs på ett inkluderande och bra sätt. Här saknas kunkap, men man får ha i åtanke att artikeln är rätt gammal nu.

> Exploring the concept of ‘equal but different partners’ is necessary. Professionals and service users bring different knowledge and skills to the process of partnership working. The contributions need to be more fully explored if we are to provide appropriate support that develops service users’ ‘different’ contribution. More work need to be carried out on exploring methods that challenge the power relations within the research process.

Hur kan vi komplettera varandras kompetenser på ett bra sätt och hur säkerställer vi att maktrelationerna är rättvisa? Här behövs mer forskning

> Evaluation of both the processes and outcomes of older people in carrying out research is required. Little is known in the field of older research about the collective and individual outcomes yet it is advocated by many, as an essential process if we are to make services more responsive to the needs of older people. Beresford (2003b, p. 57) poses the important question when referring to the way forward with research in this area when he asks, ‘Is knowledge produced from research with users more realistic and authentic than research made without this contribution?’

Vad bidrar egentligen äldre personer med genom att engagera sig på detta sätt? Vad bidrar de med som kollektiv och som individer? Detta tror jag att det idag finns mycket forskning som beskriver även om det inte fanns det när denna artikel skrevs.

> More opportunities need to be created for the sharing of experiences about the process of involvement in research and development work. There is a need to explore the common ground that exists between different groups, e.g. disabled people, people with mental health issues, people with learning disabilities. A fuller understanding is required in relation to barriers to involvement, how to overcome // these, and whether there are some that still need to be acknowledged

Mindra silos och mer lära av varandra från angränsande områden kring vad som utgör hinder för involvering av olika grupper t.ex. personer med olika funktionshinder.

De tar även om att forskningsfinansieräer måste bli mer varse att involvering kräver resurser och att etiknämnder inte behöver vara så stelbenta i sina godkännanden utan mer flexibla och se möjligheter med involvering och vad det kan ge de som involveras.

### Involving older people in research: practical considerations when using the authenticity criteria in constructivist inquiry

#### Syfte

> ...to identify practical suggestions that could enable other researchers to consider how quality may be evidenced using constructivist principles including the perspectives of older people and their caregivers.

#### Mitt omdöme om artikeln
Måste säga att den ironiskt nog eftersom den bl.a.handlade om att tillgängliggöra information för att lättare involvera äldre personer i forskning, var i svårtillgängligaste laget att ta till sig.

En rad termer nämns men ytterst sparsamma förklaringar kring vad de egentligen betyder och hur de har vuxit fram ges. 'Constructivism' anges vara något nytt och likaså att låta äldre personer delta i forskning, men det stämmer ju inte. Tycker artikeln utgör ett bra exempel på i vilket teoretiskt vakuum 'nursing' som vetenskaplig disciplin befinner sig.

### Engaging and Honoring Older Adults in Research

Inte relevant för min studie.

### Research participation by older adults at end of life: barriers and solutions

### Strategies to improve engagement of ‘hard to reach’ older people in research on health promotion: a systematic review

Här handlar det visserligen om deltagande som subjekt i mer sedvanliga forskningsstudier i form av health promotion-interventioner (och inte aktivt deltagande), men studien kan ändå vara relevant eftersom det kan finnas kopplingar mellan viljan att vara med i denna sorts vetenskapliga studier och den typ av studie som vi åsyftar. Vilka strategier bör då användas och vad är det för faktorer som påverkar viljan att delta? Arttikelförfattarna har gjort en systematic review och alltså granskat en rad artiklar inom området för att sammanställa resultatet och så här skriver de:

> Facilitators for engaging the oldest old included gaining family support and having flexible sessions. Facilitators for BME [older people from black andminority ethnic groups] groups included building trust through known professionals/community leaders, targeting personal interests, and addressing ethnic and cultural characteristics. Among older people in deprived areas, facilitators for engagement included encouragement by peers and providing refreshments. Across all groups, barriers for engagement were deteriorating health, having other priorities and lack of transport/inaccessibility. Feeling too tired and lacking support from family members were additional barriers for the oldest old. Similarly, feeling too tired and too old to participate in research on health promotion were reported by BME groups. Barriers for BME groups included lack of motivation and self-confidence, and cultural and language differences. Barriers identified in deprived areas included use of written recruitment materials. Strategies to successfully engage with the oldest old included home visits and professionals securing consent if needed. Strategies to engage older people from BME groups included developing community connections and organising social group sessions. Strategies to engage with older people in deprived areas included flexibility in timing and location of interventions.

Dock beskriver författarna att forskningen...

> has been mainly descriptive and there was no high quality evidence on the effectiveness of different approaches.

vilket bör ses som en begränsning i deras studie.

### Who is ‘in’and who is ‘out’? Participation of older persons in health research and the interplay between capital, habitus and field

#### Community engagement

Här pratas om 'community engagement' som begrepp (dock utan att någon tydlig definition ges) och författarna skriver att:

> Community engagement has developed into a widespread policy ideal that is viewed as intrinsically good as it promises democratic decision-making, empowerment and legitimacy (Bensing, 2000; Boote, Telford, & Cooper, 2002; Hanley, Truesdale, King, Elbourne, & Chalmers, 2001; Van de Bovenkamp, Trappenburg,& Grit, 2009). [p. 281]

Vilken form antar då detta engagemang? Jo, så här skriver författarna:

> This ideal has been translated into various formats and governance structures, such as patient councils, community membership of ethics committees and funding boards (Van de Bovenkamp et al., 2009). [p. 281]

#### Risker med implementeringen av 'community engagement'

> Despite the inclusive promise of engagement, however, risks of community exploitation and exclusion of patient perspectives are still pervasive (Gbadegesin & Wendler, 2006). [p. 281]

Fokuset för att identifiera riskerna  och hitta strategier för att minska dem har enligt författarna so far antingen legat på *individual agency* (och att som ett motmedel mot det försöka göra patienter och communities mer 'health literate') eller *organizational structures* (där då fokus legat på organisatoriska "facilitators and barriers that enable or limit inclusive participation (e.g. staff capacity, financial resources and accountability requirements)"). 

#### Samspelet mellan 'individual agency' och 'organizational structures' är inte tillräckligt studerat

Dock menar författarna att...

> ...there is still too little attention for a more detailed analysis of the interplay between individual agency and organizational structures in how inclusion and exclusion are shaped in mundane practices. [p. 282]

#### Strategi för att studera samspelet mellan 'individual agency' och 'organizational structures'

Och för att bättre studera detta använder de sig av följande strategi:

> To better capture this dynamic interplay, we use the Bourdieusian framework of capital, habitus and field to analyse how inclusion and exclusion are processually shaped. This framework makes visible the relations between institutional context, embedded work routines and individual decisions of actors. Additionally, we use the concept of ‘micro-advantages’ (Gengler, 2014) to show how the mobilization of capital can result in subtle advantages vis-à-vis other participating actors. [p. 282]

#### Det case på vilket denna strategi ska appliceras

De applicerar denna strategi på följande case:

> We analyse a Dutch case of target group participation in the National Program of Elderly Care (NPEC). This programme aims to improve the quality of care for frail older persons with multiple conditions by the development of (1) regional networks for care and research, in which target group panels (consisting of older persons) were positioned as important network partners; (2) transition experiments and research projects to improve the quality of care; (3) the implementation of new interventions in medical care and public health. In each, older persons were actively encouraged to participate in the evaluation, design and implementation of research and interventions. [p. 282]

#### Resultat av analysen

> The analysis showed the influence of established fields (medical and policy) on how participation of older persons was shaped in the beginning of the programme, leading to the inclusion of persons with specific forms of social capital and the exclusion of persons lacking this capital. The rules of engagement turned out to be hard to change. Even older persons with much social and cultural capital had difficulties in participating, leading to an increasing recognition that their perspective was used instrumentally. Members of the target group panels developed different strategies to respond to these difficulties. Overall, the voice of community members gradually led to substantive changes in the programme. The strategies of professionalization and responsibilization led to increased social, cultural and symbolic capital for particular groups, along with the obtainment of further micro-advantages. The downside is that participants lacking the right capital face ‘micro-disadvantages’ as a consequence of the highly specialized and professional field in which they were operating. [p. 291]

#### Vad kan man enligt artikelförfattarna ta med sig utifrån denna analys tillbaka in i den praktiska verkligheten?

Jo, följande:

> There is a growing recognition that attention for ethics and politics are crucial for the development of ‘good’ community engagement practices in research. This is evidenced by the increasing number of ethical guidelines for community engagement (Lavery et al., 2010). Yet the impact of these guidelines on biomedical research has been modest (Hasnida et al., 2017; Lavery et al., 2010). Our Bourdieusian framework offers an explanation why ethical guidelines in themselves are insufficient for guaranteeing inclusive engagement. A strongly established institutional field of global health research funding leaves marginalized actors with the need to perform continuous work to have their voices taken seriously. In order to change this, we need more than just ethical guidelines and entrepreneurial individuals. Institutional work needs to be conducted on many levels, including the level of funding (creating new funding structures), research (establishing and maintaining local research infrastructures) and community (new tools and instruments for the embedding of experience-based knowledge can strengthen the capital needed for inclusive engagement). [p. 291]

#### Slutord från artikelförfattarna

> Our analysis shows that inclusion and exclusion are not static terms but processes that change in the course of a programme. Institutional contexts and disciplinary routines have a major influence on the ways participation is shaped, and it takes time and skill to incrementally change these contexts. We conclude that it is by definition impossible to ‘exclude exclusion’ at the start of care improvement programmes. It is only in the many pragmatic and mundane choices of ‘doing participation’ that exclusion and inclusion practices are shaped. Research would therefore benefit from a processual approach in which these mundane practices are followed overtime. Participation is ongoing work and never finished. [p. 292]


### Older care-home residents as collaborators or advisors in research: a systematic review

#### Syfte

> to conduct a systematic review to find out to what extent and how older care-home residents have been involved in research as collaborators or advisors. 

#### Övergripande slutsatser

> small-scale studies involved residents as collaborators in participatory action research, whereas larger studies involved residents as consultants in advisory roles. There are multiple facilitators of and barriers to involving residents as PPI members. The reporting of PPI varies. While it is difficult to evaluate the impact of involving care-home residents on the research outcomes, impact has been demonstrated from more inclusive research processes with care-home residents. The review shows that older care-home residents can be successfully involved in the research process.

#### Facilitators of and barriers to involving residents as PPI members

Dessa kunde tematiskt grupperas under följande kategorier:

> social factors, skills, resources, care-home organisational factors and the organisation of the research. [p. 341]

##### Social factors

> The development of good relationships with residents aided involvement. Trust and transparency were important [11, 23]; residents’ trust in researcher conﬁdentiality could impact on their willingness to be involved [34, 23, 25]. Valuing residents’ involvement [32] and creating a safe space for them to voice ideas could enhance their involvement [35]. Residents’ confidence levels [34] and whether they had a low or agitated mood [29] also affected their participation, while some residents and staff could be reluctant to engage with new ideas [23]. [p. 341]

##### Skills

> Resident and researcher skills could impact on resident involvement. Cognitive impairment sometimes presented a barrier, since it meant some residents had poor knowledge and negotiating skills [23] or were prevented from taking an active role in meetings [24]. Sensory impairments such as hearing difficulties and poor vision could hinder participation [25]. To accommodate the changing health of some residents, Killett et al. [29] held their final meetings with residents in care homes rather than at external venues. Researchers’ communication and interpersonal skills were essential. Investigators had to take on the role of a facilitator or mediator in meetings or negotiations [34], foster good relationships with a variety of individuals [25, 35] and offer continued encouragement and support to residents [32]. [p. 341]

##### Resources

> Time and money were cited as barriers. In one study, a lack of funds meant that not all residents interested in contributing to the research could be involved [32]. Action research required financial resources to allow the implementation of the changes identiﬁed [35]. Spending time gaining residents’ conﬁdence and getting to know them were essential to increasing participation but, due to ﬁnancial constraints, were difﬁcult to sustain [24, 34]. One study did not provide feedback to PPI members at its conclusion due to time limitations [27]. Two studies offered care-home residents remuneration for their involvement [28, 29]. [p. 341]

##### Care-home organisational factors

> A supportive organisational culture where management and staff valued the residents’ participation in research and were open to change which might enhance involvement and helped the implementation of action research [23]. In contrast, fragmented leadership and the attitudes and abilities of key powerful individuals could work against residents’ involvement [25]. [p. 341]

##### Organisation of the research

> An emergent design was seen to be important to empower residents, since it allowed them to set the agenda and have some ownership over the study [35]. Flexibility, which could similarly encourage residents’ involvement, was shown in using informal conversations or one-to-one discussions [25, 29]; identifying a main contact or source of support for residents [27, 29]; and allowing ad hoc contact with researchers [24]. However, allowing ad hoc contact with researchers could be a challenge for research staff to respond to. [p. 341]


#### Något ordrikare slutsatser

> Few studies have attempted to involve older care-home residents in the research process. Nonetheless, some have managed to do this successfully. Older care-home residents have been involved as PPI members in two ways: as collaborators in small-scale participatory action research and as advisors on large studies. Multiple barriers to and facilitators of involving residents as PPI members were identified and can be grouped under social factors, skills, resources, care-home organisational factors and the organisation of the research. All studies involving residents in research have been predominantly qualitative in design. Future research is needed to test whether care-home residents could be successfully involved in research with a quantitative design and/or as collaborators or peer researchers, particularly in large studies involving several care homes. The reporting of PPI varies. Comprehensive reporting would allow readers to better assess the impact of PPI on the research. While it is difﬁcult at present to evaluate PPI impact in research outcomes, such impact has been demonstrated in more inclusive research processes with care-home residents. [p. 343]


### Research partnerships--embracing user involvement: practical considerations and reflections

Artikelförfattaren reflekterar i artikeln över de lärdomar som kan dras kopplat till den samverkansforskning som bedrivits vid ett forskningscenter (åldrandeforskning) på Irland under åtta års tid. Den övergripande slutsatsen är: 

> In summary, the author emphasises that for research partnerships involving users to be successful, they need to not only consider the most effective research methods, but also focus on the overarching purpose of the work and adopt an ethos and practice that maximises each partner’s knowledge and expertise to their full potential. [p. 221]

Lite lagom vagt kanske.

Denna artikel kan vara inspirerande för mig inte minst för min sista studie där jag på ett liknande sätt ska försöka sammanfatta erfarenheterna av CASE arbete med brukarmedverkan. Artiklar som denna blir av förklarliga skäl lite självhyllande, men jag tycker att den innehöll mycket bra referenser kopplade till 'user involvement'. I en starkt brittisk kontext visserligen, men jag uppfattar det som att vårt arbete vid CASE också är starkt influerat av vad britterna har gjort inom detta område. 

#### The terms collaboration, cooperation, coalition, network, strategic alliance and partnership are used interchangeably

> Terms such as collaboration, cooperation, coalition, network, strategic alliance and partnership are often used interchangeably (Boydell, 2007). [p. 221]

#### 'Empowerment' as defined by WHO
> The World Health Organization (WHO), in their 2010 report on “User empowerment in mental health – a statement by the WHO Regional Office for Europe”, describes empowerment as the process of // taking control, taking responsibility and providing the potential to build capacity. It includes four dimensions: self-reliance, participation in decision making, dignity and respect, and belonging and contributing to a wider community. The authors indicate that “the key to empowerment is the removal of formal or informal barriers and the transformation of power relations […]. Power is central to the idea of empowerment, and one important element of empowerment strategies[…]”. [p. 221-222]

#### Foucault om hur kunskap och makt hör samman

> When writing on this issue, Foucault emphasised that power is not simply a top down issue but rather a moving one, according to context and timing. He states: “Power is everywhere” and “comes from everywhere” and viewed it as neither an agency nor a structure (Foucault, 1998, p. 63). Furthermore, for Foucault power and knowledge are inextricably related, he regarded knowledge as an exercise of power and power as a function of knowledge. Therefore, in this context power can revolve around the partnership as it can around empowerment, knowledge and expertise. [p. 222]

#### O'Sullivan om vad 'effective cross-sectoral research partnerships' går ut på

> In summary, effective cross-sectoral research partnerships are focused on more than understanding the issues from a different perspective, or giving people an opportunity to have a say. Rather, it is recognition that those outside academia and one’s discipline, possess different knowledge and expertise which can benefit research and can help drive the change the partnership may wish to see happen. Principally, it is about appreciating the diversity of skills and knowledge that are academic, practical, policy based or from the lived experience. [p. 222]

#### 'User involvement' enligt Futurage

> User involvement means to concretely engage users at all stages, to design with them their role throughout the process, to take into account their needs and concerns throughout the whole process […]. This implies the need for sufficient resources, which are not only related to research funding, but also to human support. User involvement implies the sharing of research outcomes with the users who take part in the activities, as well as involving them in the evaluation and eventual follow-up (Futurage, 2011, pp. 85-6). [p. 222]

#### INVOLVE om skillnaden mellan 'user involvement', 'participation' och 'public engagement'

> INVOLVE, a National Health Service advisory group, funded by the National Institute for Health Research that supports public involvement in health and social care research, provides a useful distinction:

> + *User involvement*: members of the public are actively involved in research projects. In the health sector, this is increasingly referred to as PPI.

> + *Participation*: describes people taking part in a research study as subjects of the research.

> + *Public engagement*: information about research is provided and disseminated to the public.Activities include science festivals, open days, media and communications. The National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement describes engagement as a two-way process, involving interaction and listening, with the goal of generating mutual benefit (www.invo.org.uk; www.publicengagement.ac.uk). [p. 222]

#### Enligt Murtagh är 'user involvement' kontroversiellt och det har riktats kritik mot det

> As Murtagh (2014a, p. 11) stated: "It is important to recognise that user involvement is itself a controversial subject. Critics point to a lack of compelling evidence that it adds value, while advocates are critical of the tokenistic nature of previous attempts to engage older people in research and advocacy." [p. 222]

#### 'User involvement' används idag i syftet "to design programmes and services that are most effective"

> Nevertheless, researchers, government, funders, businesses and service providers are increasingly recognising the benefits of “user” involvement to design programmes and service that are most effective. [p. 222]

#### Bland de viktigaste tjänster, policies och program som samhället har till uppgift att få till på ett effektivt sätt hör de som riktar sig till vår åldrande befolkning

> Nowhere is this more important than in planning and delivering services, policy and programmes for our ageing population. [p. 222]

#### Issues affecting an ageing population do not respect boundaries and thus the solutions requires utilisation of knowledge and expertise from various stakeholders

> The issues affecting older people, and indeed an ageing population do not respect departmental, sectoral or indeed geographical boundaries.Therefore, providing effective planning relies on the utilisation of knowledge and expertise from a range of stakeholders especially representative organisations, charities jjand older people themselves. [p. 222]


#### Potential of 'user involvement' as described by Barnes and Taylor

> The potential of user involvement for Barnes and Taylor (2009) is that it can help research have a greater impact, produce research that is considered relevant and important by older people and their organisations as well as generate data for advocacy, service delivery and policy and can develop skills amongst older people and NGOs.

Barnes, M. and Taylor, S. (2009), Summary Guide of Good Practice for Involving Older People in Research, ERA-AGE, London.


#### Academic knowledge sometimes in conflict with knowledge of policy makers, practitioners and service users

> The drive of the user involvement agenda is reflected in Bannister and Hardill (2013, p. 5) who recognise that there are various forms of evidence and knowledge informing the design, delivery or evaluation of public services. Academic knowledge “sits alongside, sometimes in conflict and sometimes in harmony, with the knowledge of policy makers, practitioners and service users.” [p. 222]

#### Driving premise for knowledge co-production according to Vindrola-Padros et al. is that there are multiple and coexisting forms of knowledge

> Writing on the challenges of knowledge co-production, in the context of improving the quality of care, Vindrola-Padros et al. (2018) note the driving premise is that there are multiple and coexisting forms of knowledge: "The underlying assumption is that if knowledge is created through the interaction of these different groups of stakeholders, it will be able to reflect a wider range of perspectives, provide insight into the issues affecting each group, be more relevant to the local context and, therefore, more easily translatable into changes in policy and practice. (p. 1)" [p. 225]

#### A strong collaborative partnership requires a logical mixture of disciplines (and personalities) to be successful

> A strong collaborative partnership requires a vision and an interdisciplinary value base focused on utilising the expertise of those inside and outside one’s discipline and particularly outside the university gates. To be effective [...] it is not simply about getting people involved – rather it is about getting the right team mix. For an application to be successful on paper and in its desired outcome, it is key that there is a logical mixture of disciplines (and personalities) rather than just different disciplines, sectors and older people. It must be a grouping that will advance and actually benefit the outcome of the work and the partners involved. [p. 226]

#### A strong collaborative partnership requires an approach that focuses on promoting mutual dependency to build a feeling of group ownership and responsibility

> At its core there must be an ethos that promotes interdependence while respecting individual roles and expertise. [p. 226]

> What is required for success is an approach that focuses on promoting mutual dependency to build a feeling of group ownership and responsibility along with momentum. [p. 226]


####  A strong collaborative partnership requires an approach that ensures that users can be involved in a way that meets their needs, not just those of the researcher or the service planner

> ...a key element of successful partnerships involves building relationships and working in partnership with service users and older people. This requires an approach that ensures that users can be involved in a way that meets their needs, not just those of the researcher or the service planner. It may seem rather obvious but clearly explaining roles and what is expected of the various partnerships helps to avoid any confusion and disappointment or alternatively maximises valuable involvement, insight and provides opportunities that may otherwise be missed. It is also important to make it clear that the research process takes time to complete in order to ensure that the results are robust and that the research in itself does not necessarily lead to the change partner participants may wish to see. [p. 226]


#### Service users have the capacity to (alongside academics) review grants

> some funders such as The Alzheimer’s Society (Sorensen, 2009) and the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland have involved service users (families and/or people with dementia) alongside academics in reviewing grants and this model successfully shaped what was funded. [p. 227]

#### 'User involvement' måste ske med lyhördhet inför hur mycket och vilken typ av involvering äldre personer själva önskar

> ...as Doyle (2009) reflected, the case for user involvement must connect with the practicalities and realities of involvement, for example, how much or what type of involvement do older people actually want? [p. 227]

#### Lavis et al.'s three types of research/user interaction: producer-push, user pull and exchange

> Lavis et al. (cited by Bannister and Hardill, 2013, p. 5) characterise three types of research/user interaction: producer-push, user-pull and exchange: "The first of these emphasises the active role taken by researchers in communicating the messages from their research; the second highlights the need for potential research users to create an environment whereby research is actively valued, sought and used; and the third (“exchange”) outlines models of interaction between researchers and users that emphasise joint actions in the defining, creation, validation and use of research.

#### Knowledge brokerage 

> Knowledge brokerage forms an important function in connecting various groupings in the context of // supporting user involvement and developing cross-sectoral partnerships. Glegg and Hoens (2016) state: "Knowledge brokers [KB] bridge different disciplines and sectors by developing a common language, by fostering interactions between individuals that generate a shared understanding of their issues and objectives, and by reshaping knowledge to improve its meaningfulness and applicability across contexts. From this perspective, KBs move among groups fostering collaborative processes, with the aim of generating new “brokered” knowledge that is more robust and readily applicable within its intended local context (Meyer cited Glegg and Hoens (2016, p. 15)). [p. 227-228]

#### The five domains for knowledge brokering as set out by Glegg and Hoens (2016)

> ...the five domains for knowledge brokering as set out by Glegg and Hoens (2016):
> 1. Information manager: sourcing, organising, translating and sharing ageing evidence from research, policy and practice.
> 2. Linking agent: building connections and relationships between stakeholders – academic, charities, policy makers and older people across Ireland, North and South.
> 3. Capacity builder: supporting and encouraging skill development, through our funding, workshops, publications and online resources as well as addressing barriers both financial and intellectual (Murtagh, 2014a, b).
> 4. Facilitators: guiding and supporting connections across disciplines, borders and sectors including an extensive database.
> 5. Evaluators: focusing on the end use of the research and the desired outcome and impact. [p. 228]

### Initiating participatory action research with older adults: Lessons learned through reflexivity

#### Syfte

> In this article, we describe the initiation of a PAR project with older adults and reflect on the alignment of this process with key participatory principles and fit within typical research structures.

Artikeln skildrar en form av participatorisk forskning som de är tveksamt om vi bedriver. Här utgås från en viss grupp som kan liknas vid en community och den forskning som bedrivs med dem är mer aktivistisk såsom jag tolkar beskrivningen. Artikelförfattarna använder sig hela tiden av begreppet PAR och de referenser de använder använder begreppet CBPR. HÄr är t.ex. ett utdrag ur artikeln:

> Khanlou and Peter (2005) point out that researcher and participant roles are blurred in PAR, making it unclear how informed consent should be obtained, and suggest that the initiator of the research should engage community members in dialogue that could itself constitute informed consent (Khanlou & Peter, 2005).

Det är inte riktigt den typen av forskning vi bedriver skulle jag starkt hävda. 

#### Slutsatser

> Findings point to the tensions between developing relationships over time and time-sensitive calls for funding, how traditional conceptions of research can influence creating equitable partnerships, and the need for development of ethical and publishing guidelines that address participatory approaches. These key insights can be applied to help achieve the potential of PAR: to address issues of concern by collaboratively and equitably working with the people most affected.

Här är slutsatserna som dras i lite mer detalj:

> First, initiating PAR with communities and developing relationships over time is in tension with funding calls that researchers and practitioners respond to. The initial stage of this project has highlighted that it is possible to engage in PAR that starts with a researcher-led idea. There is a need to build flexibility into initial project objectives and design to enable the project to evolve and new questions to form beyond the bounded project. Equitable partnerships in this instance may take longer and require greater intentionality to establish. 

> Second, attending to issues of trust amongst collaborators and opening a space to develop trusting relationships is needed to form collaborative relationships. The nature of relationships and levels of trust/mistrust may be revealed over time; mistrust needs to be taken into consideration and, if possible, addressed, in order for a PAR project to progress. 

> Third, implementation of PAR principles can operate on a continuum, rather than a dichotomy, in which principles are implemented to the greatest extent possible. This process requires ongoing reflexivity regarding what is happening and how principles can be better integrated into a given project. Next, creating equitable partnerships can be hindered by assumptions held by co-researchers // about their potential role in research, understandings that are likely influenced by larger social conceptions of traditional research. We found that a balance between information sharing and simply “jumping in” to a project, with reflexivity, was an effective approach that enabled all involved to learn through direct experience.

> Finally, PAR principles of equitable partnerships and empowerment are balanced against REB interpretations of participants as being vulnerable and needing protection. When applying PAR approaches, an ongoing dialogue with REBs is necessary, to enable understanding of the approach by all parties and to ensure that research ethics procedures do not work against implementing PAR principles. Further development of ethical and publishing guidelines that address PAR approaches are needed

#### Key principles that Participatory Action Research (PAR) (or rather CBPR) should embody

> Israel et al. (2008) described key principles that PAR [My comment: or rather CBPR] should embody, including:
> "1. Collaborative, equitable partnership in all phases of the research project
> 2. An empowering process
> 3. Co-learning among all partners
> 4. Capacity building and systems change
> 5. A balance of research and action
> 6. Long-term involvement with a commitment to sustainability." [p. 2]

### Openness, inclusion and transparency in the practice of public involvement in research: A reflective exercise to develop best practice recommendations

Här används 'public involvement' som är det begrepp som jag också kommer att använda i studien. Jag kommer också att hänvisa till INVOLVE även om det är kopplat till en brittisk kontext. Det är ju trots allt så att vi i vår inriktning och i vårt upplägg har inspirerats mycket av Storbritanniens arbete med brukarinvolvering.

Mot bakgrund av det är det teoretiska upplägget i introduktionen väldigt relevant för min studie och jag kan hämta mycket där från teorin. 

#### Syftet

> To critically reflect on the PI practices that underpinned our research project on intimacy and sexuality in care homes, to develop a series of recommendations for improving future PI activities.

#### Resultat

> A number of strengths and limitations of our approach to PI were identified. Clear recommendations for improving PI practice were developed for three broad areas of identified difficulty: (i) communication within and between meetings; (ii) the roles and responsibilities of team members; and (iii) PI resources and productivity.

#### Definition av 'public involvement' hämtad från INVOLVE

> Public involvement in research (PI) is defined as research that is “carried out ‘with’ or ‘by’ members of the public rather than ‘to’, ‘about’ or ‘for’ them.” [1] [p. 442]

#### Chance "corridor" meetings and last-minute decision making typical of academic context could hinder effective communication in Public Involvement (PI) projects 

> a reflective report by academics and patients working together in rheumatology research research [5] revealed specific examples of typical academic working practices that could hinder effective communication in PI projects. These included the chance “corridor” meetings in the workplace from which members of  the public are excluded, as well as the pace and last­minute nature that is typical of academic decision making.

#### Mixed views as to whether members of the public should be given training in the roles they undertake [in public involvement in research]

> ...whilst many researchers have emphasized the importance of providing clear role descriptions in PI, [6-8] there are more mixed views as to whether members of the public should be given training in the roles they undertake.

#### The idea of training members of the public in research methods could be considered incompatible with the underpinning principle of public involvement

> the idea of training members of the public in research methods could also be considered incompatible with the underpinning principle of valuing members of the public precisely because of the different mindsets, skills and expertise that they bring to a research team. [3] [p. 442]

#### More research needed on public involvement roletaking and research training for members of the public

> Reflective studies that specifically consider the appropriateness of roles and training for members of the public within PI are therefore needed in order to inform this debate [on wheteher members of the public should be given training in the roles they undertake in public involvement in research]. [p. 442]

#### Many issues associated with PI relate to power relationships

> Many of the pervasive issues associated with PI, such as communication difficulties, and the nature of roles undertaken, relate to the power relationships that exist between members of the public and academic clinical or academic researchers. [p. 442]

#### Power relationship issues in PI could be exacerbated by the internal power hierarchies that often exist hhwithin health and social care settings

> Many of the pervasive issues associated with PI, such as communication difficulties, and the nature of roles undertaken, relate to the power relationships that exist between members of the public and academic clinical or academic researchers. Such issues could be exacerbated by the internal power hierarchies that often exist within health and social care settings, [10] and which risk further inhibiting effective teamwork when involving the public in multidisciplinary research teams. [p. 441]

#### Non-hierarchical team structures in PI clearly beneficial but challenging  to achieve

> Whilst there is clear recognition of the benefits of creating a non-­hierarchical team structure, in which the contributions of all team members are equally valued, [6],[11] successfully achieving such a flat power structure therefore remains a challenge. Indeed, even when academic members have the best intentions of eliminating power differentials, their desire to protect members of the public, for instance by minimizing burden, challenge or stress, may inadvertently contribute to power imbalances. For instance, researchers working with members of breast cancer self­help groups described how they were accused of being unconsciously paternalistic by a reviewer because they had not considered it appropriate to involve the self-help group members in the analysis of data.

#### Recommendations for improving PPI activities 

> ##### Communication

> * Ground rules for communication in meetings should be collectively agreed at the start of the project, and periodically revisited. These might include procedures that enable team members to easily indicate that they do not understand or wish to say something (such as raising up their hand or a coloured card), or period checks as to whether community representatives wish to contribute or clarify anything.
> * Community representatives should be given pens and paper during meetings, and encouraged to note down thoughts that come to them.
> * A glossary of common terms (used by both academics and community representatives) could be built up through discussions, and used in meetings, to help team members to understand one another’s jargon.
> * Agreement on the type, amount, and format of information sent to community representatives between meetings (including email conversations) should be agreed on an individual basis, and periodically reviewed.
> * A ‘core plus’ approach to information sent between meetings could be considered, in which all community representatives are given a core minimum of information, but with all other information made easily available, as desired.
> * If providing long documents (e.g. interview transcripts) it may be useful to provide summaries of key points, and clear cover letters that outline why the information has been sent, and what they are expected to do with it. Community representatives should also be reminded that they can challenge the summaries if they feel that important aspects from the longer documents have been omitted or misrepresented.
> * Specific social meetings should be organised between academics and community representatives to break down social barriers and increase approachability.

> ##### Roles and responsibilities
> * Role descriptions that outline the type and extent of community representatives’ involvement can be helpful for agreeing and communicating expectations. Such role descriptions should be periodically reviewed and updated, as necessary.
> * A larger team of community representatives could be involved in the project (e.g. at different times for different roles, or just to replace members who become less available) so that the sense of burden/responsibility is reduced.
> * If community representatives are interested in developing their skills, then relevant training could be provided externally or by the research team.
> * Separate meetings should be organised specifically for academic business, such as grant funding, journal selection etc. These meetings should be open to community representatives, and yet made clear that the information discussed is unlikely to be relevant to them. To maintain transparency and inclusivity, agendas for these meetings should be circulated in advance, and minutes made available afterwards.

> ##### Resources and Productivity
> * Clear details of a meeting’s objectives and agenda should be circulated in advance.
> * Community representatives should be offered folders to help them to store and organise printed information generated by the study.
> * It may be useful to have a designated member of the team (or independent person) who community representatives could approach if they have any concerns about their involvement that they do not feel comfortable raising with the wider team.
> * Sufficient time for the additional administration and meeting time required to do PI properly should be planned and budgeted for early on.

### Challenging oneself on the threshold to the world of research--frail older people’s experiences of involvement in research 

#### Slutsatser

> ...frail older people have a varied capacity to be involved. But in what way and how is difficult to know before [...] In collaboration with researchers, frail older people are given the chance to assess what they want to and are able to do. [p. 9]

> Our results advocate that it is problematic to exclude frail older people a priori and that there is potential for new perspectives and knowledge to be shaped in the encounter and in the relationship between the researcher and the frail older person. [p. 9]

> In the research relationship between the frail older person and the researcher, there are opportunities, but also obstacles based on the different worlds both come from. In research without user involvement, there are needs, perspectives and resources that run the risk of being left out. For research to be able to cater to frail older people’s needs of health services, their voices need to be heard and taken into consideration. Otherwise, there is a risk that health services will continue to treat the group of frail older people based on the wishes and perspectives of other groups. [p. 9]

### Lessons from a community-based participatory research project: Older people’s and researchers’ reflections

En mycket relevant artikel om "a community-based participatory research project that centered on the design and administration of a questionnaire exploring older people’s use and perceptions of community services" [p. 244] i vilken "[t]he authors discuss both older adults’ and the researchers’ views
of the participatory process." [p. 244] och drar följande slutsatser:

> The key lessons and challenges that emerged from the research are analyzed using the nine principles of community-based participatory research outlined by Israel et al. The authors question whether older people in all instances seek extensive involvement in all aspects of participatory projects and raise a number of questions that require further analysis before a robust and viable understanding of participatory research that safeguards against the tokenistic involvement of older people can be developed. [p. 244]

Denna artikel innehåller mycket teori och jag kommer att återkomma till den snart.

Det finns många etiketter på forskningsprojekt "that enlist the participation
and involvement of laypeople in the research process" [p. 245], bland annat: 

> "collaborative action research, action inquiry, participatory action research, and community-based participatory research (CBPR; Minkler and Wallerstein 2003)" [p. 245]. 

Även om dessa metoder skiljer sig åt så delar de enligt artikelförfattarna...

> "a central ethos: As Israel et al. (1998:175) stated, “each is explicitly committed to conducting research that will benefit the participants either through direct intervention or by using the results to inform action for change.” [p. 245] 

Alltså antingen genom direkt handling eller genom att använda resultatet för att informera och den vägen försöka påverka och få till en förändring. Därigenom distansierar sig dessa "approaches" från den traditionella modellen för hur forskning går till...

> which demarcates the researcher (as the person of knowledge) from the researched (the research subject). [p. 245]

Vet inte om jag tycker att beskrivningen av the researcher som "the person of knowledge" är särskilt generös tolkning av sedvanlig forskning eftersom det är väl ändå är så att man i t.ex. kvalitativa studier är ute efter den kunskap som personer sitter inne med på något sätt. 

Hur som helst, så vad som förenar dessa participativa metoder enligt artikelförfattarna (och alltså åtskiljer dem från traditionell forskning) är övertygelsen:

> that research should be conducted from the perspective of those immediately concerned by the issues being investigated, rather than through the lens of researchers’ preconceptions and priorities (Cornwall and Jewkes 1995). [p. 245]

och...

> Many of the participatory approaches were inspired by the philosophy and work of the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire (1970, 1973), who sought to question and realign accepted power imbalances by emphasizing egalitarian relationships and focusing on the empowerment of the disadvantaged. The tradition also evolved from the work of feminist theorists, poststructuralists, and Marxist critical theorists (Wallerstein and Duran 2003). [p. 245]

De har alltså sin upprinnelse i en känsla samt sannolikt belägg för att det råder en orättvis maktfördelning där en viss grupp i rättvisans namn behöver tilldelas en större makt och ett större inflytande jämfört med status quo. Artikelförfattarna skriver:

> The distribution of power and the empowerment of research participants are of central concern in CBPR: It seeks to empower participants by enabling them to identify issues of relevance and possible solutions to the problems they perceive.

Vidare citerar författarna Cornwall och Jewkes som skriver:

> “most participatory research focuses on ‘knowledge for action’ [and emphasizes] . . . a ‘bottom-up’ approach with a focus on locally defined priorities and local perspectives” (Cornwall and Jewkes 1995:1667). [p. 245]

#### The nine principles of CBPR, as advanced by Israel et al.

> The nine principles of CBPR, as advanced by Israel et al. (1998:178-80), are to //

> 1. recognize a community as a shared unit;
> 2. build on strengths and resources within the community;
> 3. facilitate collaborative, equitable involvement in all phases of the research;
> 4. integrate knowledge and action for the mutual benefit of all partners;
> 5. promote a colearning and empowering process that attends to social inequalities;
> 6. facilitate a cyclical and iterative process;
> 7. address health from both positive and ecological perspectives;
> 8. disseminate findings and knowledge gained to all partners; and
> 9. foster a long-term commitment by all partners. [p. 245-246]

#### Ethical value and practical advantages of participatory research

> Apart from the *ethical value* of promoting autonomy and recognizing the abilities and skills of older people (Walker 2007), participatory research has a number of *practical advantages*. It allows older people to assess the utility and relevance of particular projects and initiatives in the light of their needs (Davies and Nolan 2003). It seeks to empower them, strengthen community networks (Cornwall and Jewkes 1995), and increase the utility of research findings, thereby also creating the research-practice interface. Furthermore, its adoption can give added credibility to research findings in the community to which they relate (Cornwall and Jewkes 1995). [p. 246]

#### The involvement of older people in the research process can be viewed along a continuum

> The involvement of older people in the research process can be viewed along a continuum, from service-user informant to research analyst or, as // Walker (2007) posited, a continuum between consumerism and empowerment. [p. 246-247]

#### [Consumerism] usually amounts to older persons acting as unpaid advisers and informants

> [Consumerism] usually amounts to an older person’s acting as a research informant, offering his or her perspective either via an interview or as a participant on an advisory panel (Beresford 2003; Walker 2007). Such an approach, it is argued, generally does little to alter the distribution of power (Beresford 2003; Cornwall and Gaventa 2000). Involvement at this level is often tokenistic, or as Carter and Beresford (2000:12) pointed out, used as “window dressing for decisions that have really already been made to give an artificial appearance of involvement.” It is argued that much of this research has a negligible impact on the daily lives of the older people themselves and instead has “frequently resulted in service users acting as unpaid advisers and informants” (Carter and Beresford 2000:15). [p. 247]

#### CBPR seeks to empower participants by giving them (co)ownership of the research process 

> At the other end of the spectrum, CBPR seeks to empower participants ["by enabling them to identify issues of relevance and possible solutions to the problems they perceive" [p. 246] and] by giving them (co)ownership of the research process. In such instances, the researchers act as facilitators, helping transform the participants from passive subjects of the research project to actors and owners of the project, determining their own agenda, designing the project, and analyzing the results. [p. 247]

#### Empowerment is an elusive and complex concept and it is difficult for researchers to deem whether it has been attained or not

> Barnes and Walker (1998) emphasized the importance of self-empowerment and highlighted that empowerment in one area does not necessarily translate to empowerment in all aspects of an older person’s life. Empowerment, they argued, relates to broader sociopolitical and economic processes within society in general. Empowerment is therefore an elusive and complex concept: It is difficult for researchers to deem whether it has been attained or not. To develop nonhierarchical, empowering relationships, a researcher engaging in the participatory process also has to equip himself or herself with a suite of skills not required in conventional research (Dewar 2005; Stoeker 1999; Tetley and Hanson 2000). [p. 247]

#### Giving older persons (co)ownership of the research process is less common in participatory research than including them as advisers/informants

> With some notable exceptions (e.g., Barnes and Bennett 1998; Cook, Maltby, and Warren 2003; Dickson 2000; Joseph Rowntree Foundation 2004; Peace 1999), this approach is less common. [p. 247]

#### Lack of exploration of older people's perceptions of involvement in the process - a deficiency in the participatory literature

> A noticeable deficiency in the participatory research literature is the lack of exploration of older people’s perceptions of involvement in the process. This is highlighted by Fudge et al. (2007), who conducted an extensive literature review that aimed to explore the scope and extent of older people’s involvement in health research over the past 10 years. Of the 2,492 citations identified, only 30 met the inclusion criteria of following the basic tenets of participatory research. They noted the absence of evaluations of the research process from the perspective of older people and how their involvement altered the research process or outcomes. [p. 247]

Detta är ytterst relevant att ta upp i studie 2

#### Deficiency in the literature related to analysis of the process from the perspective of researchers

> Another deficiency in the literature relates to the analysis of the process from the perspective of researchers. Israel et al. (1998) referred to this issue and called on researchers to document the challenges they encountered and the factors that are conducive to the success of the approach. Furthermore, they suggested that such reflective exercises be centered on the nine principles of CBPR outlined above. [p. 247]

Det är också därför som de i sitt resultat redovisar forskarnas perspektiv och reflektioner och därefter tar upp hur det togs emot av de äldre personerna som deltog. 


#### Possible barriers inhibiting (active) involment of older persons in research projects

> Possible barriers identified by Fudge et al. (2007:498) are “research skills capacity, ill health, time and resources.” Other barriers contributing to attrition cited by Warren et al. (2003:25) include self-effacement, deference to professionals, and a lack of confidence. [p. 247]

Detta är ytterst relevant att ta upp i studie 2

##### Principle 1: To Recognize a Community as a Shared Unit

Här skriver artikelförfattarna att "defining and representing the “commu-
nity” within a CBPR project" kan vara utmanande vilket en viss Sullivan et al. (2003 ) tidigare har konstaterat.

Vad menas egentligen med en "community"? Jo, Israel et al (2003:55) refererar en commmunity såsom en grupp individer med en delad identitet...

> "characterized by a sense of identification and emotional connection to other members, common symbol systems, shared values and norms." [(2003:55) p. 250]

Med andra ord menar författarna utifrån den (vaga) definitionen är det ett begrepp som är svårt att operationalisera. Att t.ex. kategorisera alla personer som är 60+ inom ett visst geografiskt område upplevde forskarna som problematiskt.

Detta är ju något som jag också bör ta upp i någon form kanske som diskussion i studie 2 samt i kappan. 

Varför är det problematiskt menar artikelförfattarna? Jo, bl.a. eftersom många som uppfyllde ålderskriteriet upplevde/ansåg att forskningen inte kunde appliceras på dem då de...

> ...were not in need of additional support or were content with their current levels of social participation. [p. 251]

Istället ansåg de att forskningen war mer tillämpbar på...

> socially isolated and marginalized older people. [p. 251]

Artikelförfattarna ställer sig därför frågan om det hade varit mer lämpligt att begränsa målpopulationen eller den "community" som studerades till att endast inbegripa individer som skulle kunna kännetecknas som

> socially isolated, disempowered, and in receipt of inadequate services [p. 251]

Men ställer sig saamtidigt frågande till omdessa individer hade varit villiga eller kapabla att delta i datainsamlingen.

Detta väcker en intressant fråga kring vem som definierar en "community". Är det personer utifrån eller är det ett krav att de som anses ingå i en community själva ser det på det sättet? När det kommer till könstillhörighet är det ju så att man inte helt kan bestämma det själv, samtidigt så kan man ju i viss mån det genom att korrigera sitt kön. Lena Andersson tog nyligen upp det i en ledare i SvD, där hon menade att det inte räcker att "det känns så" utan att det krävs mer förnuftgrundade eller rationella  eller sakliga argument kopplat till sakernas tillstånd för att man ska anses tillhöra en viss grupp. DEt kan inte vara bara grundat på känsla. Artikelförfattarna skriver:

> Although in this project, the volunteers acted as a “proxy” to these populations, it is necessary to ask whether this is acceptable and whether our definition of the community was too broad. [p. 251]

Men om de skulle bestämma sig för att göra definitionen snävare och endast inbegripa de som själva såg sog som i behov av stöd, så inser de att detta kanske skulle kräva en form av träning i forskningsmetod för såväl dessa individer som för forskare:

> Many other CBPR projects are likely to encounter similar issues, and resolving these successfully may require extensive investment in building up the capacities of marginalized populations to participate. This may involve both services such as transportation (e.g., to enable individuals with mobility difficulties to participate) and supports such as interpretation and training in interviewing skills. [p. 251]

Detta kan ju kopplas till Isak Berges artikel om sköra äldre och deras möjlighet att delta i forskning.

Vidare beskriver forskarna ett visst metodologiskt dilemma i det att den participatoriska metoden gjorde att det urval som gjordes baserades på "convenience sampling" (alltså rekrytering ur de deltagande personernas bekantskapskretsar ) snarare än slumpviss urval. Och forskarna ställer sig då frågan 

> whether validity and reliability concerns should be as central to CBPR as they are in “conventional” research. Is a departure from these principles justifiable on the grounds of the greater good(s) that can be achieved with the help of the participatory approach? Can participatory research be methodologically “untidy,” and can “orthodox” notions of validity and reliability be compromised? [p. 251]

Det är en relevant fråga!

##### Principle 2: Build on Strengths and Resources Within the Community

Här menar artikelförfattarna kort och gått att CBPR-approaches möjliggjorde att så många för community:n centrala personer koplade till t.ex. lokala organisationer kunde engagera sig på de sätt de gjorde. 

##### Principle 3: Facilitate Collaborative, Equitable Involvement in All Phases of the Research

Detta uppfattades som utmanande för forskarna eftersom den önskade maktfördelningenen i praktiken inte gick att genomföra i den utsträckningen de önskade bland annat eftersom deltagarna förväntade sig att forskarna skulle vara de som höll i styra mötena de hade. Detta kanske var ett acceptabelt upplägg och det sätt som deltagande var nöjda med men artikelförfattarna ställer sig ändå frågan om:

> the use of innovative participatory group techniques, such as those used by other disciplines adopting the participatory approach (see, e.g., Chambers 1994) or advanced by Becker, Israel, and Allen (2005) might have encouraged and enabled some of the volunteers to take on a leadership role. [p. 252]

Det väcker i sin tur frågan om:

> whether older people and academics place similar importance on levels of participation within CBPR.

En mycket befogad fråga. I hur stor utsträckning vill äldre personer delta i forskning av detta slag och hur aktiv roll vill de inta? Detta är ju någt som vi i vår studie två ämnar undersöka kan man säga. Forskarnas erfarenhet från detta projekt säger dem att:

> The experiences gleaned from this project indicate that not all older people want to become “researchers” and work intensely during all stages of the process. [p. 252]

Forskarna vill att deltagarna ska agera forskare i viss mån men det är inte alla äldre personer som vill anta den rollen. Artikelförfattarns skriver vidare kring detta att: 

> many older people may prefer to participate around the midpoint of the participation spectrum. Their main priority was not to have extensive involvement in all aspects of the research but instead the translation of the research results into actions. [p. 253]

Utifrån detta ifrågasätter artikelförfattarna "gold standard:en" inom participatorisk forskning och om den verkligen formulerats utifrån äldre personers perspektiv:

> we believe that it is important to question the “gold standard” of participatory research, whereby high levels of involvement of older people in allaspects of the research are seen as preferable. We must question whether this is a standard that has been articulated by academic researchers, or older people themselves. Rather than strive for the full participation of older people in all aspects of the research process, we believe that a greater emphasis on the sharing of knowledge in all phases of the research (rather than the sharing of research tasks) may be more appealing to a large population of older people. The role of older people could therefore vary, within the same project, from that of a coresearcher to research consultant and advisor. [p. 253]

##### Principle 4: Integrate Knowledge and Action for the Mutual Benefit of All Partners 

Här anser artikelförfatterna att principen uppfyllts inom projektet och ger exempel på hur detta gåttt till.


##### Principle 5: Promote a Colearning and Empowering Process That Attends to Social Inequalities

Enligt artikelförf. är det en av de svåraste aspekter av CBPR. I det nuvarande projektet skriver artikelförf. är det svårt att göra några "substantive claims" gring huruvida "the volonteers" (som de tydligen benämns här) har blivit empowered eller inte. Artikelförfattarna önskar så här i efterhand att de gjort...

> a more systematic objective evaluation of the volunteers’ participation and related notion of empowerment in the process should have been built into the project from the outset. [p. 254]

Sedan påtakat artikelförfattarna att det finns instrument för att mäta empowerment (som de då verkar ha upptäckt för sent och därför inte använt sig av): 

> Becker et al. (2005) commented on the utility of partnership evaluation, whereby participants are given the opportunity to provide anonymous feedback on their involvement in the project by way of a questionnaire. Similarly, Barnes and Bennett (1998) commented on the usefulness of “empowerment evaluation.” The implementation of such tools would have enabled the researchers to comment on the issue of empowerment and the factors that facilitated or constrained its development to a greater extent. [p. 254]

##### Principle 6: Facilitate a Cyclical and Iterative Process

Artikelförfattarna skriver att detta gjorts i viss utsträckning  men att det kunde ha gjorts mer. 

##### Principle 7: Address Health From Both Positive and Ecological Perspectives
Med ett ekologiskt perspektiv åsyftas här ett perspektiv...

> which takes into consideration the importance of community, environment, and personal networks [p. 255]

Artikelförfattarna skriver att detta gjorts i viss utsträckning  men att det kunde ha gjorts mer. 

##### Principle 8: Disseminate Findings and Knowledge Gained to All Partners

Här redovisar bara artikelförfattarna vad de har gjort och inte så mycket till reflektion kring detta återfinns i texten.

##### Principle 9: Foster a Long-Term Commitment by All Partners

Här konstaterar artikelförfattarna att:

> Long-term goals will not be achieved in CBPR projects if planning and budgeting are not in line with the constraints that the community faces.

I detta fall kunde inte projektet avslutas inom sex månader såsom det var sagt och artikelförfattarna antyder att detta är ett problem som ofta uppkommer särskilt näi communitys där de finansiella resurserna är små. Det riktar en uppfordrande fråga till akademiker, m.fl.:

> ...academics need to question whether the participatory process, which demands a very significant time commitment, is compatible with their timetables and work obligations. What are the realistic cost estimations for such projects? Will university departments provide adequate support to CBPR researchers and recognize that in the absence of a long-term commitment, the utility and lasting effectiveness of CBPR is compromised? Moreover, the time-intensiveness of the process needs to be appreciated by policy makers and funding agencies that propound the advantages of CBPR but are in many cases not prepared to invest the funds required to permit an extended working relationship between the community and researchers. [p. 256]

#### Resultat: Older Adults’ Perceptions of the Participatory Research Process

##### Volunteers’ Motives for Involvement

Artikelförfattarna refererar till Dewar (2005) som de menar har skrivit att motivet för involvering handlar mer om att ge än att ta emot.

I det projekt som artikelförfattarna redovisar sitt resultat utifrån utgjorde också:

> an altruistic desire to assist “less fortunate and isolated” older people living in the local area was the principal motivating factor for most. [p. 256]

Dock var det inte den primära motiverande faktorn att delta för *alla**. För vissa var det istället ett potentiellt sätt att för egen del få information kring t.ex. vilka åldersspecifika tjänster som fanns att tillgå i området. Utifrån detta behov hölls också ett antal informationskväller. För andra var den primära motivet av social natur och alltså kopplat till möjligheten till att socialisera medoch lära känna andra och potentiellt få nya visvänner. Särskilt änkor/änklingar uppgav det som ett säl. För de som bodde själva var önskan om att bli mer aktiv i den lokala communityn och lära känna andra väldigt viktigt. 

#### Slutsatser

##### Danger that “moral” argument for participation obscure practical implications and realities of involvement
> there is a danger that the “moral” argument for participation may obscure the practical implications and realities of involvement. For example, how much and what type of involvement do older people want within participatory projects? How do we show adequate recognition of participants’ involvement? Should participants who work as coresearchers be offered monetary rewards? If not, does the assumption that older people wish to take part in participatory research in the absence of a monetary incentive perpetuate ageist stereotypes, that is, that older people have low expectations and are happy to invest considerable time for no monetary gain? [p. 259]

##### Transperent decision-making structures can prevent misappropriated power and control 

> the researchers believe that an emphasis on the sharing of knowledge rather than the sharing of research tasks is of greatest importance. Policy makers, researchers, and funding agencies need to be cognizant of how control can be misappropriated and reiterate the importance of knowledge sharing throughout all stages of the process. This can be achieved by stipulating that transparent decision-making structures be outlined from the outset of the project. [p. 260]

##### Important that participatory research is not hijacked as a catch-all mantra for any research that simply engages the research subjects
> important that the label participatory research is not hijacked as a catch-all mantra for any research that simply engages the research subjects. It is essential that, in line with the original intent, this model of research have the objective of extending co-ownership of the research to the people whom it concerns. [p. 260]

##### Researchers’ documenting and making transparent the methods and procedures they follow - prefarrably linked to the nine principles of CBPR as advanced by Israel et al. - leads to greater understanding of CBPR with older people

> Greater understanding of CBPR with older people would be aided by researchers’ documenting and making transparent the methods and procedures they follow. Basing an assessment of the process on the nine principles of CBPR as advanced by Israel et al. (1998) is one possible mechanism of sharing experiences in a systematic manner, and we would therefore encourage the use of this, or similar, frameworks for analyzing experiences of CBPR. [p. 260]


### Participatory Action Research With Older Adults: A Critical Interpretive Synthesis

En mycket bra genomgång av forskning inom området. Även om den fokuserar på PAR så tar den upp mycket kloka saker som även gäller public involvement av det inte lika radikala slaget.

> In this review, PAR is used as an umbrella term encompassing research approaches, such as, community-based participatory research, action research, and appreciative inquiry, which embody goals of engaging community members as co-researchers to guide personal and social change (Cargo & Mercer, 2008; Minkler, 2010).

Syftar de metoder vi använder till att "embody goals of engaging community members as co-researchers to guide personal and social change"? Jag vet inte om det är så riktigt. Får en känsla av att det i denna forskning är ett större fokus på "community" såväl som på "social change".j

#### Objective

> The purpose of this CIS [critical interpretive synthesis] was to critically evaluate the useof PAR with older adults. The key guiding question was: How are older adults meaningfully involved within each phase of the PAR process and what does their involvement entail? The central aim of a CIS is to critically engage with the data on a subject to describe the current way a topic, or in this case a research approach, is being addressed, to critically consider the strengths and limitations of current approaches, and to mark out ways forward in improving a body of research (Dixon-Woods et al., 2006). Given this focus, a CIS, as opposed to a systematic review, was selected. [e414]

#### Metoden

> Following CIS guidelines set out by Dixon-Woods and colleagues (2006), we aimed to critically question the dominant tendencies in this particular area of research, discuss what is missing, and suggest ways to move forward (Dixon-Woods et al., 2006). As such, a CIS involves both inductive analysis and interpretation in an “iterative, interactive, dynamic and recursive” process (Dixon-Woods et al., 2006, p. 9) that is flexible and allows for further development and refinement of the research question, depending on what the researchers identify in the articles (Dixon-Woods et al., 2006). This review was therefore conducted iteratively, where steps were re-visited at multiple points in time, involving a literature search and selection, data extraction, and synthesis. [p. e414]

#### Slutsats: One factor that may explain why academic researchers have tended to not fully involve older adults as prominent partners is the current funding environment, whereby academics often require a defined research topic to obtain funding

> One factor that may explain why academic researchers have tended to not fully involve older adults as prominent partners is the current funding environment, whereby academics often require a defined research topic to obtain funding (Frisby et al., 2005; Hall & Tandon, 2017). These requirements unfortunately limit the possibilities of an emergent research design that ensures that the research priorities chosen matter to the community (Hall & Tandon, 2017). To ensure that older adults are able to shape the purpose and scope of PAR projects, there is a clear need for funding agencies to create alternative funding structures, such as planning grants for initial stages and tiered funding connected to meeting outcomes demonstrating successful partnerships (Cargo & Mercer, 2008). Such strategies would support researchers in collaborating with older adults in cycles of reflection and action that enable older adults to contribute to PAR projects so that the project’s goals and objectives are optimally relevant to them (Hall & Tandon, 2017). [p. e423]


#### Slutsats: The pressure to publish makes it difficult for academic researchers to ensure that the research priorities chosen matter to the community, to involve older adults throughout the various research phases, and to involve older adults when implementing the findings in a way that encourages tangible change in the community

> Unfortunately, the pressure to publish makes it difficult for academic researchers to integrate the time and processes required to ensure that the research priorities chosen matter to the community, to involve older adults throughout the various research phases, and to involve older adults when implementing the findings in a way that encourages tangible change in the community.

#### Slutsats: Greater alignment is needed between the ethics guidelines of institutional review boards and the goals of PAR so that older adults can be involved as co-researchers

> In addition, ethical guidelines may hinder academic researchers from meaningfully involving older adults. The emphasis on individual rights and protections embedded in the guidelines used by many ethics review boards at academic institutions may present as barriers to more collective participatory processes (Cargo & Mercer, 2008). For example, research ethics boards often want participants to sign consent forms when a project begins, which could position the older adults as participants rather than as co-researchers in an equitable partnership (Hand, Laliberte Rudman, McGrath, Donnelly, & Sands, 2019). Although obtaining consent to share information is important for academic researchers who wish to publish and present research findings, it is clear that greater alignment is needed between the ethics guidelines of institutional review boards and the goals of PAR so that older adults can be involved as co-researchers (Hand et al., 2019; Frisby et al., 2005). Specifically, researchers should engage in ongoing dialogue with research ethics boards when conducting PAR so that all parties can discuss the methodology to ensure that the institution’s ethics procedures are not working against the researchers’ implementation of PAR (Hand et al., 2019).
