The overarching aim was to investigate the awareness and attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among 60+ citizens in Sweden.
One specific aim was to report descriptive results regarding awareness and attitudes. Focusing on willingness to be actively involved in research on ageing and health, another specific aim was to investigate its relationship with demographics and health.

The analysis for the second specific aim was guided by the following research question: How do the willingness of 60+ citizens to be actively involved in research on ageing and health relate to sex, age, economic situation, level of education and perceived health?
