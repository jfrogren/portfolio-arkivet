The overarching aim was to investigate the awareness and attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among 60+ citizens in Sweden.
One specific aim was to report descriptive results regarding awareness and attitudes. Focusing on willingness to be actively involved in research on ageing and health, another specific aim was to investigate its relationship with demographics and health.

The analysis for the second specific aim was guided by the following research question: How do the willingness of 60+ citizens to be actively involved in research on ageing and health relate to sex, age, economic situation, level of education and perceived health?

> "Results indicate that selective nonparticipation takes place in digital health research (in this case the HF-Wii study that  evaluated the impact of exergaming on the exercise capacity and daily physical activity of patients with HF. Exergame is a term that refers to video games that can beused for exercising, often at home).. and that it is associated with age and symptom severity. Gender effects cannot be proven. Such systematic selection can lead to biased research results that inappropriately inform research, policy, and practice."

En artikel som på ett mer ingående sätt beskriver hur det kan te sig att låta äldre personer agera medforskare. Slutsatsen är att det finns fördomar som florerar åt båda håll mellan forskare och äldre personer men att 'interim reflection meetings' kan vara ett fruktbart sätt att komma till bukt med dem och också ett fruktbart sätt att skapa en ömsesidig förståelse och därigenom utvecklas tillsammans.

> Interim reflection meetings – at which mutual expectations were expressed along with a frank discussion of prejudices, tasks and role divisions, and the sharing of personal and project-related needs and information – were found to be fruitful in achieving a positive working relationship and fostering an effective collaboration. We conclude that a learning perspective on participation can be a resource for learning and adaptive change.

Dessutom ger den i inledning en omfattande motivering till varför äldre personer bör inkluderas i forskning på detta sätt. Det handlar med hänvisning till en viss Walker (2007) om två orsaker: en 'epistemologisk' och en 'ontologisk' och här finns kopplingar till Frickers begrepp. Epistemologiskt handlar det om att...

> Older people have a specific perspective concerning ageing and service use, which is based on and informed by their experiential knowledge. This knowledge is gained through the daily experiences of older people with their own ageing and the care they receive. Furthermore, older people may have concerns about interventions in health care which go overlooked by policy makers and researchers. [2]

Alltså om äldres unika kunskap och erfarenhet som det krävs att äldre själva delar med forskare i någon form för att den ska kunna upptas och tas i beaktande av forskare. Här hänvisar Bindels et al. till tidigare forskning som visat att:

> - older people’s understanding is needed to attune ageing research agendas and methods, to better address their needs, and the ﬁndings are more likely and better able to enhance the quality of their lives (Davies and Nolan 2003)

> - The blending of scientiﬁc knowledge with experiential knowledge in ageing research is slowly becoming more accepted as a means of increasing the practical relevance of research and validating the research process and its findings (Reed, Stanley and Clarke 2004).

När det kommer till den ontologiska anledningen att involvera äldre personer i forskning skriver Bindels et al. så här: 

> A second, ontological reason for the involvement of older people in research concerns their rights as citizens to influence decisions which could affect their lives in the long term, and the need to further social justice and human rights in the context of power differences between people (Carter and Beresford 2000; Mertens 2009). This argument is particularly strong with regard to older people because of their experiences of age discrimination, marginalisation in society and other forms of social exclusion (Walker 2007). It is not a question of whether to involve older people, but how and to what extent.

Här är det alltså en fråga om medborgerliga rättigheter att få vara med att påverka de beslut som påverkar en, och här skrivs uttryckligen med hänvisning till Walker (2007) att äldre personer är utsatta för åldersdiskriminering, marginalisering i samhället och andra former av exkludering. 

Detta är starka argument för att äldre personer ska delta aktivt i forskning om åldrande och hälsa, men görs detta då? Nej, inte enligt Bindels et al.:

> Although older people form the core business constituency for many health-care organisations, they are often excluded from clinical trials. This is a side effect of the age and protocol restrictions that are used to create homogeneous study populations (McMurdo, Witham and Gillespie 2005). Researchers are afraid, moreover, that the enrolment of older people will cost more time and will require more expertise and work-hours due to issues such as hearing and visual impairments (Habicht, Witham and McMurdo 2008).

I kvalitativt inriktad forskning utgörs det vanliga deltagandet av en form av passivt deltagande där äldre personer inte ges möjlighet att påverka forskningsprocessen:

> In qualitative research, including older people in research as respondents in interviews or as focus group participants is the most common form of participation. The older person has no direct influence on the research process when such methods are used.

Men frågan är hur stort inflytande äldre personer egentligen har att påverka utformandet av våra studier? 

Enligt Bindels et al. vad utmärker då ett mer aktivt deltagande? Jo, så här skriver de:

> In order to genuinely involve older people in the research process and to honestly collaborate with them, one needs to go further; older people can become advisors, interviewers, co-researchers or even initiators of research (Abma and Broerse 2010).

Den form av engagemang de söker är alltså att äldre personer i forskningsstudier ska utgöra rådgivare, intervjuare, medforskare (co-researchers) eller till och med initiativtagare.

Så här definieras medforskare (co-researcher):

> Co-researchers in ageing research are older people who collaborate on an equal basis with academic researchers in research teams. Older people can use their experiential knowledge in conversation with the researchers, thereby actively influencing the research process, for example by co-developing the research design. Both the academic researcher and the co-researcher have access to speciﬁc forms of knowledge, be it scientific or experiential; both can thus be seen as experts. The acknowledgement of the older person as an expert forms the basis for an equal relationship between co-researchers and professional researchers (Abma and Broerse 2010; Abma, Nierse and Widdershoven 2009). [3]

Har sådana typ av studier bedrivits där äldre personer deltagit på detta sätt? Ja, Bindels et al. ger exempel på två studier (Reed et al. 2002 & Cornes, Peardon and Manthorphe 2008) och skriver att:

> Both studies describe how research collaboration with older people can have great beneﬁts for researchers, older people and services. In collaborating with end users in research, however, special attention should be paid to empowerment and equal relationships. [3]

Vad utmärker då 'equal relationships' och 'equality' i detta sammanhang? Jo, så här skriver Bindels et al.:

> Equality should be achieved by allowing every team member [3] to exercise, improve and develop different skills, and thereby position themselves to maximum efficacy within the team (Cornes, Peardon and Manthorpe 2008). [4]  

Alltså att ge varandra förutsättningar att öva upp och förbättra sina förmågor. En smula vagt kanske, efterson det är lite för allmänt formulerat för att gå att visualisera tydligt.

'patient engagement research' = ännu ett begrepp, syftar till att 'to incentivize patients to become more engaged in their health and health care.' (p.1058)

> The development of engagement research in health has been difficult to achieve because of the long-standing power differentials between patients and care providers and researchers [4]. Some of the particular barriers to engagement have been identified: the need to prepare patients to engage in research; the need for journals to be open to including articles written in a patient voice and to make these bridge articles available through open access to a number of audiences [p. 1058]

Mycket av forskningen inom området har varit inriktad på att dokumentera och definiera (graden av) detta engagemang:

> Much of the work to date on patient engagement in research has focused on documenting and defining patient engagement/involvement/activation that consider; when engagement takes place, the degree of engagement, what activities patients engage in, who is involved, and the processes used [8–11]. These definitions are fluid and depend on the country, the system, the funding formats or the disciplines or domains under study.
