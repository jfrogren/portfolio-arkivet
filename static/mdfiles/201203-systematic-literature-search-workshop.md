# Notes from systematic literature workshop 3 December 2020

When finding relevant search terms - sometime try to think “opposite” for papers on participation perhaps look at restricted/immobilized

* PICO - a structure to find all relevant search terms - investigate intervention studies
* PEO - another model when investigating associations and relationships
* Be exhaustive but specific :-)
* OR to get synonyms AND to combine different areas

## Access to databases:
* Direct link: <https://www.med.lu.se/english/intramed/teaching_research/research/search_services> 
* Go via LUBsearch and search for relevant databases


## Truncation
Truncation (*) find all words despite different endings. Hous* would give results on housing, house etcetera.


## Strategies and tactics for various databases

### PUBMED
The MeSH term “aged” reflect older adults, but sometimes in PubMed you can get hits like “infants aged 6 to 18 months” - these you can omit by using filters

If you get a lot of pre-clinical hits (studies on mice, cells etcetera) you can use the the filter “humans”

Want to know what keywords the authors use on their publications - do not use MeSH terms instead use “other terms” or “free text” or “title/abstract”

### CINAHL
Cinahl subject heading - find their specific language (similar to MeSH)

Move your search to another database in EBSCO host, for example PsychInfo: 
choose database, tick the ones you want, and then rerun the search

Use LUBsearch vs search via different databases: 
For an orientation search LUBsearch is great - but for a systematic search use databases and their specific search terms

### Multidiciplinary databases: 
* LUBsearch
* Web of science
* Scopus
* Google Scholar

## How to keep track of synonyms and databases

Start a word file with a table where you can save synonyms along the way
Keep a list of databases relevant to you - share with coworkers
Save searches and create alerts on good searches (then you will get an email) For example: Ebscohost: Go to search history, use save searches/alerts.
Use the word file “sökstrategi” from the library to save good search terms. (This file is sent out to researchers who want to get help from the library to do systematic searches, but maybe it can be a good document for your independent use as well.

## EndNote
If you want to learn more about EndNote and how to make it more useful to you - book a session with Maria, Krister and or their co-workers.

## Write a systematic review (publication):
Software that can help you in the process are Ryyan and Covidence. LU has now a university licence on the latter one.
