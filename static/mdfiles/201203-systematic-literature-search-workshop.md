# Notes from systematic literature workshop 3 December 2020

When finding relevant search terms - sometime try to think “opposite” for papers on participation perhaps look at restricted/immobilized

* PICO - a structure to find all relevant search terms - investigate intervention studies
* PEO - another model when investigating associations and relationships
* Be exhaustive but specific :-)
* OR to get synonyms AND to combine different areas

# Search support from librarian

## Background 
I had scheduled a time slot today with a librarian in order to get some help with conducting systematic literature searches for study II. Part of the feedback that I received in my half-time review and by my supervisors afterwards was that I need to update my theoretical understanding of the problem at stake. An efficient and recommended way of doing that was through creating adequate search strings and conduct systematic searches in various relevant databases. 

For this particular literature search I aimed to update myself on knowledge and knowledge gaps related to study II. 

## Aim and RQs for study II
Here is the aim and research question for that study: 

> The overarching aim was to investigate the awareness and attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among 60+ citizens in Sweden. One specific aim was to report descriptive results regarding awareness and attitudes. Focusing on willingness to be actively involved in research on ageing and health, another specific aim was to investigate its relationship with demographics and health.

> The analysis for the second specific aim was guided by the following research question: How do the willingness of 60+ citizens to be actively involved in research on ageing and health relate to sex, age, economic situation, level of education and perceived health?

## Search sring I had created before the meeting
The search string I envisioned looked like this, but when reflecting upon it the string was perhaps primarily intended as a search for the doctoral project in its entirety:

````
(citizen* OR public* OR people* OR patient* OR individual* OR person* OR user*)
AND (attitude* OR belie* OR opinion* OR perceiv* OR perception* OR idea* OR judgement* OR “ways of thinking” OR experience* OR aware* OR willing* OR value* OR impetus* OR incentive* OR inclination* OR interest* OR motive* OR reason* OR wish* OR disposition* OR drive*)
AND (involv* OR engag* OR participat* OR collaborat* OR user-driven OR patient-driven OR co-produc* OR transdisciplinar* OR community-based)
AND (research* OR scien*)
AND (ageing OR aging OR older OR elderly)
````

However, the librarian thought it looked good as a starting point and together we started to create searches in different databases with this search string as a basis.

## Psychinfo; Socindex; CINAHL:

The librarian thought that the database *Psychinfo* was a good starting point for my focus. This database, she explained belongs to the same group of databases as Socindex and CINAHL. We tried a number of different search strategies and search strings in primarly Psychinfo but also in the other databases and the ones considered giving the best results are listed here:

````
TI ( (citizen* OR public* OR people* OR patient* OR individual* OR person* OR user*) ) AND TI ( (involv* OR engag* OR participat* OR collaborat* OR user-driven OR patient-driven OR co-produc* OR transdisciplinar* OR community-based) ) AND TI ( (research* OR scien*) )

TI ( (citizen* OR public* OR people* OR patient* OR individual* OR person* OR user*) ) AND TI ( (involv* OR engag* OR participat* OR collaborat* OR user-driven OR patient-driven OR co-produc* OR transdisciplinar* OR community-based) ) AND TI ( (research* OR scien*) )

TI ( (citizen* OR public* OR people* OR patient* OR individual* OR person* OR user*) ) AND TI ( (involv* OR engag* OR participat* OR collaborat* OR user-driven OR patient-driven OR co-produc* OR transdisciplinar* OR community-based) ) AND TI ( (research* OR scien*) ) AND AB ( (ageing OR aging OR older OR elderly OR senior*) ) (i databasen SOCindex + CINAHL)

AB ( (citizen* OR public* OR people* OR patient* OR individual* OR person* OR user*) ) AND TI ( (involv* OR engag* OR participat* OR collaborat* OR user-driven OR patient-driven OR co-produc* OR transdisciplinar* OR community-based) ) AND TI ( (research* OR scien*) ) AND AB ( (ageing OR aging OR older OR elderly OR senior*) ) 
````

The librarian explained that if I get thousands of hits, I can just look through the first 100-200 hits, that's enough.
 
## Scopus:
I also conducted a few searches in good old *SCOPUS*, a database that I am more familiar with and the best search string out of the ones I tried was the following:

````
ABS((citizen* OR public* OR people* OR patient* OR individual* OR person* OR user*)) AND TITLE((involv* OR engag* OR participat* OR collaborat* OR user-driven OR patient-driven OR co-produc* OR transdisciplinar* OR community-based)) AND TITLE((research* OR scien*)) AND ABS((ageing OR aging OR older OR elderly OR senior*))) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE,"ar" ) ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( LANGUAGE,"English" ) ) 
````

What remains to be done now is to go through the hits I get for the various searches and identify at around 30-40 articles that seem very relevant and then read and summarize them to get a better understanding of what knowledge there is and what knowledge is lacking.# Search support from librarian

## Truncation
Truncation (*) find all words despite different endings. Hous* would give results on housing, house etcetera.


## Strategies and tactics for various databases

### PUBMED
The MeSH term “aged” reflect older adults, but sometimes in PubMed you can get hits like “infants aged 6 to 18 months” - these you can omit by using filters

If you get a lot of pre-clinical hits (studies on mice, cells etcetera) you can use the the filter “humans”

Want to know what keywords the authors use on their publications - do not use MeSH terms instead use “other terms” or “free text” or “title/abstract”

### CINAHL
Cinahl subject heading - find their specific language (similar to MeSH)

Move your search to another database in EBSCO host, for example PsychInfo: 
choose database, tick the ones you want, and then rerun the search

Use LUBsearch vs search via different databases: 
For an orientation search LUBsearch is great - but for a systematic search use databases and their specific search terms

### Multidiciplinary databases: 
* LUBsearch
* Web of science
* Scopus
* Google Scholar

## How to keep track of synonyms and databases

Start a word file with a table where you can save synonyms along the way
Keep a list of databases relevant to you - share with coworkers
Save searches and create alerts on good searches (then you will get an email) For example: Ebscohost: Go to search history, use save searches/alerts.
Use the word file “sökstrategi” from the library to save good search terms. (This file is sent out to researchers who want to get help from the library to do systematic searches, but maybe it can be a good document for your independent use as well.
