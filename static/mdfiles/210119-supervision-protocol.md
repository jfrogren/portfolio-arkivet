## Protocol for Joakim's supervision 19 January 2021

> Due to technical problems, RL was unable to participate in the supervision.

### 1. Study I
OJ gave a short report on the situation with the manuscript, which we received back from the reviewers and the editor last week, with only requirements for minor revisions (although they did not turn out to be so small when the revision work began). The editor expected to get the script back after only five days, but after negotiations, OJ had been given an extended deadline for Tuesday next week, i.e. today. After intensive revisions by mainly OJ but to some extent also other co-authors, OJ reported that he intends to send in the article manuscript later today.

### 2. Study II

SI expressed a strong disappointment that JF, despite admonitions, has not been able to take a holistic approach to the article and, above all, has not improved the method section to a greater extent since the half-time seminar. JF was now expected to address this immediately.

JF expressed that he found it unclear exactly which survey results would be presented under results. SI said that this was something that JF himself must take a position on based on the purpose of the study. OJ pointed out that the things you do not include in the result, you usually do not need to argue that you do not include.

The low response rate should in itself be a result, said SI, because it is something that needs to be addressed in the discussion. Thus, the response rate should be included in results even if it normally does not.

In other respects, JF was recommended to, in order to move quickly in the writing of the method part, study the study protocol for the study well and also read other quantitative studies and see how they have described their method. Here, for example, a [dissertation from CASE](https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/perceived-aspects-of-home-health-and-wellbeing-among-people-in-sweden-aged-6770-years(a345cb23-91c2-48f2-ae57-c07f1610248f)/publications.html) was mentioned. Furthermore, JF was instructed to add a heading, called 'Instruments' or 'Variables', (which precedes 'Statistical analysis'), where it is clearly stated which variables or instruments are used and based on which reasoning.

As for which journal to publish the article in, this was also something that needed to be addressed soon. SI suggested that PlosOne could be one option.

### 3. Study III

Due to lack of time and technical problems with Zoom, the conversation about study III was limited. What was said, however, was that it was important to start work on an ethical application soon, as it took time and resources and would soon need to be submitted to the ethics committee, if the study could proceed as planned. SI said that she might call for a meeting about study III before the next supervision.


### 4. Timetable

Although the proposed timetable sent by JF was considered more detailed than the previous one, it was considered very optimistic. As an example, it was pointed out that only one week set aside to formulate an ethics application was unrealistic. In addition, time was not set aside for e.g. write discussion. To what extent the schedule could be followed, time would tell, but these shortcomings were clearly pointed out.

### 5. Next supervision
Next supervision was decided to be held via Zoom on **February 2 at 14.30-16.00**. JF will send the draft of the manuscript for Study II on January 28. <br><br>Zoom link: <https://lu-se.zoom.us/j/68032635203>
