## Protocol for Joakim’s supervision 3 November 2020

### 1. Study II

#### Data cleaning
Joakim reported that cleaning the data took longer than expected, partly due to shortcomings of the survey company but that this process was now about to be finalized. Roderick pointed out that the survey company had certain responsibilities for this and if they did not deliver the quality expected there ougth to be consequences. Susanne added that most data sets had some kind of issues and that this should not be an excuse for a delay in the process.

#### Study aim and research question
Before further data analysis, deciding on study aim(s) and research questions was found a necessary step. This should have been decided already, according to Susanne and Oskar, considering that several meetings had been held in which the study had been discussed. It was now urgent for Joakim to come up with a suggested aim and suggested research questions (which could then be further elaborated in collaboration with the co-authors) as soon as possible. 

#### Survey question related to 'willingness'
As of now, the only thing decided in relation to the study aim was that the respondents 'willingness to participate actively in research (on ageing and health)' should be central to the focus of the study. Here Joakim suggested that question 7 in the survey, i.e. "Would you consider actively participating in research on ageing and health?", should be used to analyze whether respondents were 'willing' or not to participate actively in research, partly based on the result of a google form that had been sent out to all co-authors where they had identified this as a question linked to 'willingness'. 

In addition, a recent study by Lakomy et al. (2020) exploring incentives motivating individuals to become involved in life sciences research used a similar question as a basis for measuring willingness, namely "Would you consider being involved personally in life sciences research?". The results from that study indicated that men and younger individuals were more persuaded by extrinsic motives (external benefits or rewards), whilst women and older people were driven by intrinsic motives (that originates from within an individual). 

#### Survey question related to 'incentives' or 'motivational factors'
In relation to incentives motivating 60+ citizens to participate actively in research on ageing and health survey question 12, i.e. "What could motivate you to participate actively in research on ageing and health?", was suggested by Joakim as to question to be used to analyze the respondents' motivations. Here, the respondents were given twelve alternatives. These alternatives could be link to Camilla Malm’s (another PhD student within the UserAge program who is analyzing the corresponding data set but for informal carers) study about extrinsic/intrinsic motives among informal carers to participate actively in research on ageing and health. Susanne suggested that if Camilla has already done a factor analysis related to motivations, I should take that and apply that to my data set. Susanne thought that Camilla had divided the motivational alternatives not into extrinsic/intrinsic but into the following three categories: a) Personal benefits; b) Contributions to the (greater good); c) Contributions to the development. Joakim was asked to approach Camilla and see how she had analyzed the question(s) in the survey relating to motivations and to take inspiration from her approach. 

#### Confounders
Furthermore, Oskar mentioned that 'rural and urban living environments' could be confounders relating to 'willingness', which is a concept that has been pointed out as central to the analysis in earlier meetings. 'Distance to University' could potentially be coded as well. However, it was decided that 'Distance to University' was not a priority to code. Rather, it was decided that if an effect of urban vs. rural was found, then 'Distance to University' could be added to the analysis as well if considered to be interesting enough.

#### Way forward
It was decided that Joakim will formulate and mail suggested study aim(s) and research questions for study II within a week from when this meeting was held. Furthermore he should send out a first draft of the manuscript for study II by lunchtime on December 7.

### 2. Systematic literature review

In the last supervision, Joakim was asked to conduct a proper systematic literature review in order to better connect his PhD project and its individual studies to the adequate research literature. Joakim explained that he had so far constructed a search string, conducted a search in the SCOPUS database to see the number of hits it generated (=361) and in addition received some feedback on from Oskar and Susanne on the search string syntax. This was the search string Joakim had suggested:

> (citizen* OR public* OR people* OR patient* OR individual* OR person*) 

> AND (attitude* OR belie* OR opinion* OR perceiv* OR perception* OR idea* OR judgement* OR "ways of thinking" OR experience* OR aware* OR willing* OR value* OR impetus* OR incentive* OR inclination* OR interest* OR motive* OR reason* OR wish* OR disposition* OR drive*)

> AND (involv* OR engag* OR participat* OR collaborat* OR user-driven OR patient-driven OR co-produc* OR transdisciplinar* OR community-based)

> AND (research* OR scien*)

Oskar's feedback was that he wondered if the search string was intended to be used for an individual study or more broadly for the entire project. He also thought that the search string had an emphasis on citizens but that it omitted aging. Susanne thought that the following terms were missing: ‘user’; ‘communication’; 'knowledge translation’. In addition, she thought that the “approaches” we had identified such as ‘MODE 2’, ‘PPI’,’Participatory Action Research’ might also be fruitful to include.

Roderick comments concerned the time frame and whether or not the search should be limited to a Swedish or Scandinavian context. He also thought that 'ageing/aging' should be included in the search.

It was decided that the time frame should be set to 2000-2020; not restricted to a Scandinavian or Swedish context; that the search would include titles, abstracts and keywords; that it should contain only peer-reviewed articles and no gray literature; and that Joakim should conduct one generic search for all studies but then add (and deletes) some terms for the particular studies. Based on these instructions, Joakim will meet up with a librarian and perform literary searches as soon as possible.

### 3. Study I

Roderick had sent his detailed feedback on study I to Oskar, Susanne and Joakim a few weeks ago. During the meeting, Roderick summarized his feedback stating that the manuscript in its current form needed to link better to relevant literature on accessibility building and specifically to what had been done earlier by researchers at CASE. Here [WHO's Housing and health guidelines](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241550376) provided a good resource, he suggested. Additionaly, he thought that the study needed to anchor the concept of wicked problem more thoroughly in theory. Furthermore, in the conclusion we needed to more explicitly articulate what we had learned from the RC sessions and how it added to the current state of knowledge; what added value of using the RC we saw and whether using the method in the current way had enabled us to learn something new.

Joakim suggested an [article](https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/39517) by Mayring describing more explicitly and step-by-step the deductive content analysis method. However, Oskar pointed out that no critical comments had been given about deductive content analysis by the reviewers and Susanne stated that there was no time or idea to go back and redo the analysis at this point but that the article could very well be used later in my doctoral dissertation.

To summarize, it was decided that whilst Joakim would continue to focus on study II, Oskar would edit the manuscript of study I based on the initiated feedback provided by Roderick and the external reviewers. Then he would send the manuscript to Susanne who would send it to Joakim. It was considered realistic to submit the manuscript before Christmas or sonn after. 


### 4. Prolonging of doctoral studies due to Joakim's engagement in various boards outside of actual studies
Based on what was written in the document *Riktlinjer för förlängning av anställning som doktorand pga.
förtroendeuppdrag inom studentorganisationer och studentrepresentation vid Lunds universitet* (in Swedish) that Joakim had sent out before the meeting, a discussion was be held about the possibilities to prolong Joakim's doctoral studies due to his engagement in various boards. Susanne emphasized that even though the deadlines could be somewhat postponed due to Joakim's engagement elsewhere it would still require the same work load. Joakim was encouraged to edit his Gantt chart according to the updated deadlines.

### 5. Next supervision
Next supervision was decided to be held via zoom on **December 11 at 14.30-16**. Joakim will send the first draft of the manuscript for study II by lunchtime on December 7. Zoom link: <https://lu-se.zoom.us/j/62394249273>
