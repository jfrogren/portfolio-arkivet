### 1. Study II
RL, OJ and SI provided JF with their feedback on the manuscript. 

#### The current 'Introduction' needs to be rewritten
The current introduction is not a proper introduction, according to RL, but rather an attempt of a review of the key issues in this particular field. According to RL, it could be deduced from the text that there were three reasons for public involvement: a) Social justice (though RL thought that more recent examples than experiments during the Nazi era would both be more appropriate and needed, such as mentioning that in the first phase of corona virus, older persons were treated as a problem); b) To raise older persons' self-esteem (empowerment); c) Knowledge production.

He found that if such a review should be included it needed both to be more concise and synthesized. What he found lacking was a section on how to bring in the experiential and unique knowledge of the elderly into the research. The narritive character of that knowledge is interesting here and point to make, according to RL, is that the experiential knowledge of the elderly should not fit into the scientific analysis but rather complement it. What is furthermore lacking in this review of key issues, RL found, is a concluding synthesizing section. At the end of the day, who decide? An extra paragraph in the end that summarizes it up, would be expected in a proper review of the key issues.

SI pointed out that it is impossible to get papers with this kind of broad introductions published. Only small parts from intro relevant for this study. A quite different approach is required. This introduction does not suit with an empirical paper that was supposed to be produced; Rather it fits into a 'kappa'. 

Thus, it is necessary - all the supervisors agreed - to take the whole section out and write it again from scratch. 

In order to get a better idea of what an introduction of this sort should contain and be built up, OJ gave the advice to look at the paper by Lakomy et al. (2020) entitled ['The motivation for citizens' involvement in life sciences research is predicted by age and gender'](<https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237140>) for inspiration.

#### Low response rate no obstacle to get paper published
OJ pointed out that a similar study as ours by [Lakomy et al. (2020)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237140) had a 5% response rate in the survey, and since they have been able to published their article, our 29% response rate (more than 800 persons participating) shouldn't be an issue. 

#### Response rate presented in 'Results'
SI, said that the response rate should not be placed in the method section, but it should be part of the results. The reason is that the low response rate is in itself a result that should be brought up in the discussion.

#### Motivated to include motivations in the descriptives of the study
OJ pointed out that in the study by [Lakomy et al.(2020)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237140) the authors clearly stated that more research is needed related to what motivates older persons to be actively involved in research. Thus, it is motivated to include motivations in the descriptive statistics presented in the current study.

#### The choice of journal affects the format
SI explained that once we decide in which journal we should strive to publish the article in, we then know more in detail what format is expected and can frame the manuscript accordingly in order to make it publishable. She suggested that PLOS ONE could be one good option (where Lakomy et al.'s article was published) but nothing was decided.

#### Method description premature and hard to follow 
All the supervisors found the method description very premature as well as hard to follow. RL said that he was confused by the term 'Measures' in this context and JF explained that he had found this term used in similar articles (by for example [Haak et al. (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167494315300170) & [Lakomy et al. (2020)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237140)). SI found 'Study question variable' a better term to use than 'measure' in this context.  
Moreover, OJ suggested to provide the reader with a table were the survey questions that had been asked could be listed, rather than in running text. Both OJ and SI said they would send me their written feedback on the manuscript where their ideas of improvements were laid out in more detail, in particular in the methods and results section.

#### Results without the regression are no real results
The supervisors also found the results section very premature. It looked more like a presentation of descriptive data than something to be expected to be found in a results section. SI said that in terms of analyses there seemed to have been no noticeable improvements since the half-time review, which she thought was a huge disappointment. In order to bring the manuscript forward it was an absolute necessity and a prioritized first step to conduct the much expected logistic regression. Without those results, the work of trying to take this manuscript further was like treading water, RL said.

#### A much more developed manuscript expected for next supervision
Thus, we agreed that it is absolutely necessary that JF produces a much more developed manuscript until the next supervision. It should include:

* All parts of the manuscript 
* Results (with the logistic regression)
* Bullet points with the discussion


### 2. Study III

SI gave a brief update on the project upon which the study is based. An initial meeting will take place on **11 February 2021** with a representative from ['Vetenskap & Allmänhet'](https://v-a.se/) [Science & Public] who is the organization behind the event, discussing the set-up and how to go about. 

What has been decided is that within the frames of JF's study the focus will be on older persons' 'capacities' and 'willingness' to participate in a citizen science project of this kind. RL was invited to take part in this meeting if he wished, SI explained.

The actual event ['Bostadsförsöket'](https://forskarfredag.se/forskarfredags-massexperiment/bostadsforsoket/) [The Housing Experiment] during which the data collection will occur will take place in September, peaking on the third Friday of that month. Due to the COVID situation, school pupils and older persons will not do any accessibility measurements together, as was initially planned. Rather, these groups will work separately, making accessibility measurements separately in their home environment.
While school pubils will be engaged through their schools, older persons will be recruited through pensioners' organizations.

The data collected on accessibility in housing will be continuously uploaded to a server via the Internet during the project. In this way, through a downloadable app on the mobile phone (or Ipad), it will be possible to see how many people have done accessibility surveys and what the most common environmental barriers are in different parts of the country. It will also be possible to see, based on a number of disability profiles, what constitute the main obstacles for a certain group, such as e.g. wheelchair users, etc.

There will be support in the form of for example a Facebook group and one idea is that JF would form part of this support group, and thereby be able to carry out his data collection; For example, by analyzing how many people contacted the support via Facebook and what topics was discussed there. Here, RL expressed concern that this might risk taking up too much of JF's time. However, SI pointed out that it was important that JF was directly involved in the process of collecting data in at least one of his studies, on that this project constituted a great opportunity for this.

What will be discussed at the first meeting on the 11th, SI further explained, in addition to the layout, are also questions about how sensitive data should be handled. Thereafter an ethics application must be formulated, and such an application does not only consist of the writing itself but must be preceded by a lot of thought work. Therefore, JF's planning in its schedule to set aside only one week for this is very frugal. Once the ethics application has been submitted, it takes an average of eight weeks to receive a response, SI explained.

### 3. Other questions
JF's delay is becoming a very serious issue. SI will inform the head of a department about the situations and what measures should be taken. 

### 4. Next supervision
Next supervision will be on **1 March 2021 at 10.30-12.00**. JF will send the updated manuscript to the supervisors on 23 February.
