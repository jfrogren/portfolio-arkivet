+++ 

## Description of thesis work
The overarching aim of my PhD project is to gain a better understanding of the involvement of representatives of citizens and certain professions in research on ageing and health. To *involve* someone in research in this context refers to the participants being active partners in the process and not just study objects. Through four different sub-studies and employing various approaches of involvement, insights will be gained related to how such joint efforts are perceived, what outcomes they could bring (in terms of learning outcomes and knowledge contributions) and what the pitfalls are. Three of the sub-studies (sub-study II-IV) engages 60+ citizens whilst one of the studies engages representatives of various professions with an expertise related to housing and ageing.

## How the PhD project relates to ageing
The PhD project relates to ageing in the sense that ageing and health research constitutes the context in which the involvement of the representatives occur. Furthermore, the representatives that the researchers in this case strive to involve are expected to have a certain knowledge or experience (expertise) that relates to ageing and health issues. As mentioned above in a majority of the sub-studies 60+ citizens will be engaged which means that the PhD project will have a stronger emphasis on involving this age group compared to representatives of professions. 

## Theories related to ageing used in PhD thesis
The involvement of citizens as well as representatives of certain professions has its roots in the strive for empowerment for these groups. 
democratic strive as well as a way of acquiring necessary perspectives and knowledge in relation to the issue at stake.
