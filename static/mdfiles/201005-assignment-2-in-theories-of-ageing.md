## Description of thesis work
The overarching aim of my PhD project is to gain a better understanding of the involvement of representatives of citizens and certain professions in research on ageing and health. To *involve* someone in research in this context refers to the participants being active partners in the process and not just study objects. The involvement of citizens and professionals in research has its roots in the intertwined quest to enhance democracy and adequately manage complexity and uncertainty [@hronszky2005].Through four different sub-studies and employing various approaches of involvement, insights will be gained related to how such efforts are perceived, what outcomes they could bring (in terms of learning outcomes and knowledge contributions) and what the potential pitfalls and limitations are. Three of the sub-studies (II-IV) engages 60+ citizens whilst one of the sub-studies (I) engages representatives of various professions with an expertise related to housing and ageing.

## How the PhD project relates to ageing
The PhD project relates to ageing in the sense that ageing and health research constitutes the context in which the involvement of the representatives occur. Furthermore, the representatives that the researchers in this case strive to involve are expected to have a certain knowledge or experience (expertise) that relates to ageing and health issues. As mentioned above in three out of four of the sub-studies 60+ citizens will be engaged which means that the PhD project will have a stronger emphasis on involving this age group compared to representatives of professions.

## Theories related to age and ageing used in PhD thesis

There are many answers to the question of what ageing is. It is inevitable that biology plays a crucial role and that a theory such as ‘disposable soma’ [@kirkwood1999] is fundamental to the understanding of what ageing means. Some researchers in gerontology even claim that research on ageing should solely consist of research focused on biological aspects and that related research should not be considered research on ageing at all but rather something else [@hayflick2016]. However, already in 1939, the philosopher John Dewey wrote in relation to ageing that: “Biological processes are at the root of the problems […] but the biological processes take place in economic, political, and cultural contexts” [cited in @achenbaum2016, p. 695]. Not least in the last 50 years, has there been convincing research studies indicating how thoroughly interconnected these aspects are. In other words, it is highly questionable how fruitful it is to isolate ageing and ageing research to simply being a question of biology. On an overall level, this PhD project takes on a ‘life-course perspective’ [@bengtson1993] where ageing and developmental change are seen as continuous processes that are experienced throughout life.

### Epistemic injustice
One theory relevant for the PhD project is the theory of **Epistemic injustice** [-@fricker2007] formulated by the philosopher Miranda Fricker. It refers to "wrong done to an individual specifically in their capacity as a knower" [@fricker2007, p. 1]. The injustice in question is a result of certain people being excluded in whole or in part from the construction of knowledge even though they have valid reasons to contribute. This is not a theory deriving from or specific to ageing research. Rather, it is originally linked to the exclusion of individuals due to their gender or ethnicity. However, considering that ageism in addition to sexism and racism is demonstrably prevalent in our times the theory is here seen as having a potential of being applicable even to this context where age is a key factor. Fricker argues that there are two subcategories of epistemic injustice: ‘testimonial injustice’ and ‘hermeneutical injustice’. The former is about the credibility of a speaker’s testimony. Normally when a person listens to another person’s statement, the listener makes an assessment of the credibility of the speaker and what has been uttered  [@goldberg2013]. Becoming a victim of ‘testimonial injustice’ occurs in cases where the listener attributes too little credibility to a speaker’s testimony in relation to what is justifiable in the situation. The approach can be linked to prejudice(s). This kind of injustice is epistemic in nature because it takes a position on the speaker based on the knowledge he or she is considered to possess. However, it is important to mention that the theory does not in any way claim that all knowledge is equally important regardless of context. The kind of knowledge that it speaks of here is knowledge that is clearly relevant in a certain context and thus for justifiable reasons ought to be taken into account, but which is still completely or partially ignored.

‘Hermeneutical injustice’ is about injustice in relation to how people interpret their lives and what they experience. It occurs when certain individuals’ experiences are not well understood by themselves or by others because their experience does not fit into any pre-defined concept that is known to them or to others. This kind of injustice is, according to Fricker, rooted in the fact that these individuals belong to a certain group that has historically been excluded from activities - such as research or journalism - with the power to shape which concepts are being constructed, brought into the limelight and established.

Epistemic injustice is not only a democratic issue, but it also has the consequence that the knowledge of a certain phenomenon is limited because some of those who possess relevant knowledge are not able to speak on equal terms as others. Given that many of the problems found in ageing and health today are of a social nature and are characterized by a complexity and uncertainty, it is important that all relevant knowledge and experience from all key actors is taken into account. Thus, it is of the utmost importance as a researcher to gain an understanding of whether and, if so, to what extent and in what ways epistemic injustices occur. If not, the understanding of these problems and the solutions that may be launched risks ignoring relevant aspects and thus leading to the production of knowledge, products and services that do not prove to be sustainable or put into use because they are considered to be of limited relevance.

### Contingent and existential ageing
  Furthermore, borrowing ideas from critical and humanistic gerontology, this PhD project also makes a distinction between **contingent** and **existential limitations** in relation to ageing [@baars2014]. Contingent limitations here refer to obstacles that are of a social nature and that can be remedied, e.g. poor housing conditions, insufficient care, social isolation, starvation or ageism. Existential limitations, on the other hand, refer to limitations that are inevitable results of senescing and finitude. However, it should be pointed out here that what at a certain historical time has been considered an existential limitation, over time may constitute a contingent limitation. Examples of this is weakened vision and the invention of glasses. Even though our modern society testifies that life can be improved in many ways, human life in general and human ageing in particular raise more questions than social policy and the sciences can answer, according to Baars and Phillipson [-@baars2014]. Such questions arise throughout life but become inevitable when people live longer, and this is about us having to develop meaningful ways of dealing with situations in life that cannot be controlled. According to Baars and Phillipson [-@baars2014], late modern cultures of ageing have difficulty acknowledging and *dignifying* limitations that cannot be overcome but must be respectfully and creatively integrated in ways of living.

Baars and Phillipson's views on contingent and existential ageing are further elaborated by Dannefer and Lin [-@dannefer2014], who divide ‘contingent ageing’ into ‘structural’ and ‘hermeneutic’ aspects. Interestingly, there are here obvious parallels to the aforementioned subcategories of epistemic injustice in that structural aspects are seen as linked to prejudice(s), while hermeneutic aspects are about concepts being created and categorical divisions made about certain people without sufficient consideration of how they themselves interpret their lives and what they experience. With regard to ‘existential aging’, Dannefer and Lin [-@dannefer2014] make tentative attempts to link this concept to basic human needs (based on theories in motivational and social psychology) and then find that *competence*, *autonomy* and *relatedness* can be considered to constitute these needs, and that the difficulty of fulfilling them increases with age (above a certain age).

The division into contingent and existential limitations in relation to ageing does not constitute a uniform full-blown theory. Nevertheless, it still provides a fruitful lens to use when approaching the research questions within the PhD project. It indicates that the involvement of citizens and representatives requires a responsiveness in relation to issues that not necessarily can be solved through social policy or research efforts but still need to be acknowledged.
